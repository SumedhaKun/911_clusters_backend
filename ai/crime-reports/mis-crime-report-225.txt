POLICE REPORT

Incident Type: Breaking and Entering, Burglary 
Date/Time of Incident: March 15th, 2023 at approximately 2:30 AM
Location: 457 Oak Tree Lane, Oakwood suburb

Summary of Incident:
On the morning of March 15th, officers responded to a call reporting a breaking and entering at a residential home located at 457 Oak Tree Lane. Upon arrival, officers found signs of forced entry through a ground floor window at the rear of the property. 

The victims, a married couple in their late 50s, reported being awoken by loud noises from the kitchen area around 2:30 AM. When the husband went to investigate, he encountered an intruder inside their home. No weapons were brandished, but the suspect shoved the husband to the ground and fled on foot out the back door.

Crime Scene Investigation:
Forensics teams processed the scene and found evidence that the suspect gained entry by removing the screen from a kitchen window and using a pry bar to force it open. Muddy shoe prints were recovered from the kitchen floor, indicating the suspect tracked in dirt and debris from outside.

Pry marks were found on the window frame, and tool marks suggest a flathead screwdriver may have also been utilized to jimmy the lock. However, no tools were recovered from the scene.

The victims reported that several pieces of jewelry, cash, and electronics appeared to have been stolen from the premises, though they are still taking inventory of missing items.

Suspect Description: 
The victims were unable to provide much detail, describing the suspect as a male around 5'10" wearing a dark hooded sweatshirt, jeans, and gloves. No other distinguishing features were noted.

Investigating officers canvassed the neighborhood but were unable to locate any witnesses or surveillance cameras that may have captured the suspect's movements. The case remains open as detectives continue examining evidence from the scene.
