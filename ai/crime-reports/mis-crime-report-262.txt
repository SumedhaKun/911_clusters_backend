POLICE INCIDENT REPORT

Case Number: 2023-07182

Crime Type: Aggravated Burglary

On May 15th, 2023 at approximately 2:37 AM, officers responded to a call reporting a burglary in progress at the First National Bank on Main Street. Upon arrival, officers discovered signs of forced entry through the rear entrance of the building.

The suspects, who remain at large, appeared to have used common burglary tools such as a pry bar and a lock picking kit to gain access to the secure location. Security footage from the bank's cameras captured three individuals dressed in dark clothing and wearing ski masks.

Once inside, the suspects proceeded to the vault area, where they encountered resistance from the bank's security guard on duty, Frank Jennings (32). According to Jennings' statement, one of the suspects threatened him with a 9mm semi-automatic handgun and struck him in the head with the weapon, rendering him unconscious.

The suspects then used a cutting torch to breach the vault door, allowing them to access the safety deposit boxes and cash reserves inside. The total amount of cash, valuables, and securities stolen is currently estimated at over $2.5 million.

Forensic evidence recovered at the scene includes:
- Pry bar with distinct markings
- Remnants of accelerant used with the cutting torch
- Partial fingerprints lifted from the vault area

The suspects fled the scene in what is believed to be a dark-colored SUV. Witnesses reported hearing tires screeching as the vehicle sped away from the bank.

This case is currently under active investigation by the Robbery/Burglary Division. Any individuals with information regarding this incident are urged to contact the police department immediately.
