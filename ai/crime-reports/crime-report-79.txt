INCIDENT REPORT
Case #: 2023-04785
Incident Type: Kidnapping 

On May 12th, 2023 at approximately 8:15pm, the Colorado Springs Police Department received a call about a possible abduction near the corner of Pikes Peak Ave and Tejon St in downtown Colorado Springs. 

The victim, Sarah Henderson (28), was walking alone after having dinner at a nearby restaurant. According to an eyewitness, two men wearing black ski masks approached Ms. Henderson from behind as she was nearing her vehicle parked on the street. One of the suspects grabbed her forcefully and covered her mouth with his hand to prevent her from screaming while the other subdued her by binding her wrists together behind her back with rope.

Despite Ms. Henderson's attempts to fight back and break free, the suspects were able to overpower her using physical force and drag her into a waiting black van with tinted windows. The van sped off heading westbound on Pikes Peak Ave immediately after the abduction occurred.

The entire incident lasted approximately 2-3 minutes according to the witness statement. No weapons were reportedly seen or used during the kidnapping. However, the suspects are believed to have potentially used duct tape as a restraint on the victim once inside the van based on evidence collected at the scene.

Ms. Henderson's vehicle was left parked and undisturbed at the location with her purse and other belongings still inside, indicating this was likely a targeted abduction and not an attempted robbery or carjacking.

The Colorado Springs PD is urging anyone who may have witnessed the incident or has any information regarding the identity or whereabouts of the suspects to contact the authorities immediately. An Amber Alert has been issued statewide for the missing victim.

The investigation is active and ongoing. More details will be provided as they become available.
