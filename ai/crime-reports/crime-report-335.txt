POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case #2023-04785

Crime Type: Burglary

On the night of April 17th, 2023, a high-stakes burglary occurred at the First National Bank in downtown Metropolis. Evidence at the scene indicates that the perpetrators utilized a mode of access involving bribery to gain entry into the secure vault area.  

According to surveillance footage, at approximately 2:15 AM, two masked individuals arrived at the bank's employee entrance. One of the suspects, dressed in a dark hoodie and jeans, approached the night security guard on duty. The second suspect, wearing a baseball cap and sunglasses despite the late hour, kept watch from their getaway vehicle parked across the street.

The hoodie-clad suspect is seen engaging the security guard in conversation before surreptitiously passing him a thick envelope, likely containing a large bribe. The guard appears to hesitate briefly before swiping his keycard and allowing the suspect entry into the restricted area.

Once inside, the perpetrators employed typical burglary tools like a pry bar, bolt cutters, and a cutting torch to crack into the reinforced vault door. No explosive devices or firearms were utilized during the crime itself, though the suspects were armed with semi-automatic pistols as a deterrent against any resistance.

The daring heist netted the thieves an estimated $7.2 million in cash, bearer bonds, and other valuables stored within the vault. They escaped the scene in a dark colored SUV before police could respond to the silent alarm triggered by the vault breach.

Forensic teams are analyzing fingerprint and DNA evidence recovered from the scene in hopes of identifying the suspects. Police are also reviewing the bank's internal procedures and conducting interviews to determine if any other employees may have been involved or compromised by bribes.

This brazen burglary has raised concerns about the security protocols at financial institutions throughout the city. The Metropolis Police Department is working closely with federal agencies and utilizing all available resources to apprehend those responsible and recover the stolen loot.
