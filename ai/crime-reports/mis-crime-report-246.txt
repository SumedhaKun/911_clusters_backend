INCIDENT DETAILS:
On the evening of April 17th, a daring armed robbery took place at the Main Street Bank in the downtown area. According to witness statements and surveillance footage, three masked individuals gained access to the bank by disabling the rear security door using a commercial-grade lock picking kit. 

Once inside, the suspects held several bank employees at gunpoint while one of the perpetrators accessed the vault using a high-powered thermic lance cutting torch. The suspects were able to breach the vault and make off with an undisclosed amount of cash and valuables contained within multiple safety deposit boxes.

During the robbery, the suspects displayed extreme violence, physically assaulting two bank employees who did not immediately comply with their demands. The weapons used included semi-automatic pistols, which the suspects brandished and fired warning shots to intimidate the victims and witnesses.

After robbing the vault, the three suspects exited through the same rear entrance, leaving behind a heavily damaged vault door and two injured but stable bank employees. Witnesses describe the getaway vehicle as a late model black SUV with no visible license plates.
