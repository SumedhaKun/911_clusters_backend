POLICE REPORT
Case #: 2023-047829
Incident: Automobile Theft

On April 15th, 2023 at approximately 11:30 PM, officers responded to a call regarding a vehicle theft in progress at the Oakwood Apartments complex located at 825 Maple Lane. Upon arrival, officers interviewed the victim, Jessica Martin (28).

VICTIM STATEMENT:
Ms. Martin stated that she had just returned home from work around 11:15 PM and parked her 2019 Honda Civic (license plate ABX-2391) in her assigned parking spot in front of Building 4. As she was walking towards the building entrance, she heard the distinct sound of her car alarm going off. 

She turned around and witnessed two males wearing dark clothing, ski masks, and gloves smashing the front driver's side window of her vehicle with a small sledgehammer. One suspect then reached through the broken window and unlocked the door from the inside.

Both suspects then entered Ms. Martin's vehicle. One suspect began hot-wiring the ignition using a screwdriver and pair of wire strippers, while the other kept lookout. Within a minute, the vehicle was started and the suspects drove off at a high rate of speed out of the complex's main entrance onto Maple Lane heading east.

EVIDENCE COLLECTED:
- Small sledgehammer (possible make: Stanley)
- Shattered automotive glass from driver's side window
- Screwdriver set
- Wire strippers

The vehicle's GPS tracking system indicated it was last pinged approximately 3 miles away at an abandoned warehouse district before the signal was lost, likely due to the GPS being disabled.

Forensics are working to collect fingerprint and DNA evidence from the recovered tools. Security footage from the apartment complex is also being analyzed to hopefully identify the suspects.

The stolen vehicle is still outstanding and a BOLO (Be On the Lookout) has been issued to all jurisdictions. The investigation is ongoing.
