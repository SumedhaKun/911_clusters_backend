Police Report #2023-0415

Incident: Residential Burglary/Theft 

Date/Time: April 15, 2023 - Approximately 2:30 AM

Location: 725 Oak Tree Lane, Oakwood

On April 15th at around 2:45 AM, officers responded to a residential burglar alarm at 725 Oak Tree Lane. Upon arrival, they discovered signs of a forced entry through the front door. The door frame was damaged and the lock was broken, indicating the use of a pry bar or similar tool. 

The homeowners, John and Jane Smith, were awoken by the noise of the intruder(s) entering. Mr. Smith went to investigate and encountered a masked individual in the upstairs hallway. A physical altercation ensued where Mr. Smith was pushed to the ground, but no weapons were brandished or threats made. 

The intruder then proceeded to ransack the upstairs bedrooms, taking a laptop computer, jewelry box, and Mrs. Smith's purse containing cash, credit cards and personal items. The total value of stolen goods is estimated at $5,000.

Evidence collected at the scene included tool marks on the front door frame, suggesting the use of a pry bar or similar leverage tool to force entry. Scuff marks and a torn piece of black clothing were also found, possibly from the physical altercation with Mr. Smith. No fingerprints were recovered.

The suspect is described as a male around 6 feet tall with an average build, wearing a black hooded sweatshirt, black pants, gloves and a ski mask covering his face. He is believed to have fled on foot.

Detectives are reviewing nearby residential security cameras for any footage that may have captured the suspect's approach or escape route. The burglar appears to have specifically targeted this home, using lock picking tools and brute force to gain entry while the residents were present and asleep.

The investigation is ongoing. Anyone with information is urged to contact the Oakwood Police Department at ...
