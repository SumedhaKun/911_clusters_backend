POLICE REPORT

Case Number: 2023-0415-0078
Date of Report: April 15, 2023
Reporting Officer: Detective J. Davis, Fraud Division

Nature of Incident: Fraud

On April 12, 2023, the fraud division received a complaint from Ms. Emily Watson, a 68-year-old retiree residing at 215 Oak Street. Ms. Watson reported that she had been the victim of a fraud scheme perpetrated by an unknown suspect.

According to the victim's statement, on April 10th, she received a phone call from an individual claiming to be a representative from the "National Sweepstakes Bureau." The caller, who identified himself as "John Williams," informed Ms. Watson that she had won a grand prize of $2.5 million in a sweepstakes she did not recall entering.

The suspect, using a practiced and convincing tone, explained that to claim her prize, Ms. Watson would need to provide her bank account information and pay a processing fee of $5,000. Excited by the prospect of winning such a substantial sum, the victim complied and provided her bank details over the phone.

Later that day, Ms. Watson received another call from the suspect, who claimed that an additional fee of $12,000 was required to complete the prize claim process. Growing suspicious, the victim refused to pay any further fees and contacted her bank to report the incident.

Upon investigation, it was discovered that a total of $17,000 had been withdrawn from Ms. Watson's account through several unauthorized transactions. The suspect employed deception and false pretenses to obtain the victim's financial information and fraudulently access her funds.

No physical tools or weapons were used in the commission of this crime, as the suspect relied solely on the mode of deception and manipulation over the phone to perpetrate the fraud.

The fraud division has obtained recordings of the phone conversations and is working to trace the origin of the calls. All available resources are being utilized to identify and apprehend the suspect responsible for this despicable act targeting a vulnerable elderly victim.

This case remains under active investigation by the Fraud Division.
