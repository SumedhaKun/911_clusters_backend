POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case #2023-04182

Date: April 18, 2023
Nature of Crime: Perjury 

On the afternoon of April 18th, 2023, officers were called to the Greendale County Courthouse regarding a report of perjury taking place during an ongoing trial. Upon arrival, officers interviewed the presiding judge, prosecutors, and several witnesses who were present during the alleged crime.

According to statements, the defendant, John Smith (45), was under oath testifying in his own defense during a high-profile racketeering and money laundering case. During cross-examination by the prosecution, Mr. Smith provided contradictory statements and outright fabrications regarding his whereabouts and activities on several key dates related to the alleged crimes.

Multiple witnesses, including members of the jury, confirmed that Mr. Smith knowingly and willfully lied under oath on numerous occasions in an apparent attempt to mislead the court and obfuscate the facts of the case against him. No tools or weapons were used to facilitate the perjury, as Mr. Smith simply provided false verbal testimony from the witness stand.

After a thorough investigation and review of the court transcript, the decision was made to charge Mr. Smith with the felony crime of perjury. He was immediately taken into custody at the conclusion of the day's proceedings.

In a written statement, District Attorney Maria Rodriguez stated, "Perjury strikes at the very heart of our judicial system's ability to find truth and uphold justice. We will not tolerate anyone lying under oath in a court of law, regardless of the circumstances. Today's events should serve as a firm warning that perjury will be aggressively prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law."

Mr. Smith is being held without bail pending an arraignment hearing next week. If convicted of perjury, he could face up to 5 years in prison in addition to any sentence related to the original racketeering and money laundering charges.

Case remains open pending further legal proceedings.
