POLICE REPORT #2023-0416

Crime Type: Cyber Attack, Data Breach  

On April 16th, 2023 at approximately 2:15 AM, the Summersville Police Department's Cyber Crimes Unit received an alert from the security team at First National Bank regarding a suspected data breach. Upon initial investigation, it appears an unauthorized party gained online access to the bank's customer database and downloaded thousands of customer records containing personal and financial information.

The cyber criminals utilized common hacking techniques to bypass the bank's digital security protocols. Based on the evidence collected so far, the attackers first conducted phishing campaigns against bank employees to install remote access malware on the internal network. The malware allowed them to move laterally and escalate privileges until reaching the customer data repository.  

No physical force or weapons were utilized in the cyber attack itself, as the criminals operated remotely by infiltrating the bank's systems online. However, the stolen data poses serious risks of financial fraud, identity theft and other cyber crimes against the impacted customers.

Forensic analysis is underway to determine the full scope of the breach and whether any additional malicious code was implanted in the bank's systems. The Cyber Crimes Unit is working closely with the bank and external cybersecurity firms to implement incident response protocols, lock down the network, and identify the perpetrators.  

Any individuals receiving suspicious emails, phone calls or alerts related to this incident should not provide any information and immediately contact the authorities. The investigation is active and ongoing. More details will be provided as they become available.
