SUMMARY OF INCIDENT:

On the morning of April 17th at approximately 2:15 AM, officers responded to a call of a home invasion and assault at 125 Oak Street, Apartment 3B. Upon arrival, officers encountered the victim, Sarah Jenkins (28), who had sustained serious injuries. 

According to the victim's statement, two masked assailants forcibly entered her apartment through the front door, which showed signs of being pried open with a crowbar. The suspects then bound the victim's hands and feet with zip ties and physically assaulted her in an attempt to get her to reveal the access code to her home safe. 

When the victim refused to comply, one of the suspects struck her in the face repeatedly with his fists while the other brandished a 9mm semi-automatic handgun and threatened to kill her if she didn't cooperate. Fearing for her life, the victim eventually provided the code.

The suspects then accessed the safe, stealing approximately $35,000 in cash and jewelry. They also took the victim's cell phone and laptop before fleeing the scene. Neighbors reported hearing yelling and a commotion but did not witness the suspects leaving.
