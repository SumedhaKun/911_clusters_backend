POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case #: 2023-04785

Crime Type: Burglary/Home Invasion  

On the night of April 17th, 2023, a home invasion occurred at 415 Oak Tree Lane. The homeowners, John and Jane Smith, reported that they were awoken around 2:30 AM by loud noises coming from the first floor of their residence. 

Upon investigating, Mr. Smith encountered two masked intruders in the hallway who immediately attacked him. The suspects gained entry by hot-wiring the exterior electrical panel to disable the home's security system and alarm. They then used a crowbar to force open a ground-level window in the den area.

One of the suspects, armed with a baseball bat, struck Mr. Smith in the abdomen while the other brandished a hunting knife, holding Mrs. Smith at knifepoint as she came down the stairs. The suspects bound the victims' hands and feet with zip ties.

The intruders spent over an hour ransacking the home, stealing jewelry, electronics, cash, and other valuables. Before fleeing, they sprayed the victims with pepper spray as a parting gesture. Neighbors reported seeing two men wearing dark clothing hastily leaving the scene in a late-model black sedan.

Forensics recovered tool marks from the forced entry point as well as DNA evidence from the crowbar and baseball bat. The investigation is ongoing as police examine security camera footage from nearby homes for potential leads on the suspects' identities and vehicle.
