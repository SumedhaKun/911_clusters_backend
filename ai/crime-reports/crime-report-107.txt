POLICE REPORT

Case Number: 2023-04856

Crime: Extortion 

Date: April 17, 2023

Location: Downtown Financial District 

Summary of Incident:

On the afternoon of April 17th, the victim, John Smith (32), a wealthy investment banker, reported being the target of an extortion attempt. According to Smith's statement, he received a series of threatening phone calls and emails over the past week from an unknown individual demanding a large sum of money in exchange for not releasing damaging information about him.

Smith claimed the perpetrator utilized threats and intimidation tactics, warning that if the monetary demands were not met, they would publicly expose alleged details about Smith's supposed involvement in insider trading and tax evasion schemes. The suspect did not physically force entry or use any weapons, instead relying on psychological coercion through the threatening messages.

The extortion amount demanded was $500,000, to be paid in unmarked bills to a specified drop location. Smith stated he initially ignored the threats, believing them to be a prank, but became alarmed when the perpetrator provided specific details about his personal and financial life that were not publicly known.

Smith reported feeling extremely anxious and intimidated by the aggressive language used in the communications. Out of fear for his reputation and career, he strongly considered paying the extortion amount before ultimately contacting the authorities.

The police cyber crimes unit has initiated a trace on the email accounts and phone numbers used to make the threats. Security footage from locations mentioned in the demands is also being reviewed for potential leads on the suspect's identity.

Smith has been advised to cease all communication with the perpetrator and to document any further threats or demands received. Additional security measures have been implemented at Smith's residence and workplace.

The investigation remains ongoing as law enforcement works to identify and apprehend the individual responsible for this extortion attempt through threats and coercion.
