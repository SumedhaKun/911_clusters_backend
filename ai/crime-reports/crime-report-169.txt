INCIDENT REPORT
Case #: 2023-04718
Date: April 12, 2023

OFFENSE: Corruption of Public Officials 

INCIDENT SUMMARY:
On April 10th, 2023, an anonymous tip was received by the Public Integrity Unit regarding potential bribery and corruption involving City Councilmember Jane Doe. According to the tip, Councilmember Doe allegedly accepted bribes from local real estate developer Michael Smith in exchange for expediting building permits and zoning approvals for Smith's new high-rise condominium project.

INVESTIGATION DETAILS:
Undercover surveillance was initiated on Councilmember Doe and Developer Smith. On April 11th, video footage captured the two meeting at an upscale restaurant. Lip reading analysts observed Smith discreetly sliding an envelope across the table to Doe. Doe was then seen placing the envelope in her purse.

A court order was obtained to search Doe's residence. Inside her home office, investigators discovered the envelope which contained $25,000 in cash. Bank records show a series of large cash deposits into Doe's personal account totaling over $100,000 in the past six months.

Additionally, email records revealed correspondence between Doe and Smith discussing "incentives" and "expediencies" related to Smith's condo project that had been stuck in zoning purgatory for months. Within two weeks after the recorded money handoff, permits were swiftly approved.

CHARGES:
Based on the evidence obtained, the following charges have been filed:

Jane Doe - Corruption, Bribery of Public Officials, Embezzlement 
Michael Smith - Bribery, Corruption of Public Officials

Both subjects have been taken into custody and are awaiting arraignment. The investigation is still ongoing to determine if additional co-conspirators were involved.
