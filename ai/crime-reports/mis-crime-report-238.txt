POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case #: 2023-04718

Crime Type: Burglary (Residential)

Date/Time of Incident: April 17, 2023 / Between 7:30 PM - 10:45 PM  

Location: 825 Oak Tree Lane, Oakwood

Victim(s): John and Mary Robertson

On the evening of April 17th, the Oakwood Police Department received a call from Mrs. Mary Robertson reporting a burglary at her residence. Upon arriving at the scene, officers discovered signs of forced entry through a window on the side of the house.

The kitchen window had been smashed, with shards of glass lying on the ground outside. The window frame showed marks consistent with the use of a pry bar or similar tool to force it open. Once inside, the perpetrator(s) ransacked the first floor of the home.

According to the victims, several valuable items were stolen including:
- Mrs. Robertson's jewelry box containing an assortment of rings, necklaces, and earrings (estimated value $7,500)
- A 55" flat screen television from the living room  
- Mr. Robertson's laptop computer and external hard drive from the home office
- Around $300 in cash from Mr. Robertson's wallet

The total losses are estimated at approximately $11,000. 

No security cameras were installed on the property, and there were no witnesses in the area at the time of the incident. However, officers did find a single fingerprint on the broken window frame that has been collected as evidence.

The perpetrator(s) gained entry by smashing the window with a blunt object, potentially a small pry bar or hammer based on the impact fractures. They likely remained in the home for 1-2 hours completely ransacking the first floor.

Forensics teams have processed the scene, and the investigation is ongoing. Canvassing of neighbors is underway to identify any suspicious activity or potential witnesses. The burglar(s) used forced entry as their mode of operation and may have specifically targeted this home.
