POLICE INCIDENT REPORT

Case Number: 2023-04718
Date/Time Reported: 04/17/2023 03:21

TYPE OF CRIME: Arson

SUMMARY: 
On the morning of April 17th at approximately 3:15 AM, the Oakwood Fire Department received multiple 911 calls reporting a structure fire at the vacant warehouse located at 128 Main Street. Upon arrival, firefighters encountered heavy smoke and flames billowing from the rear loading dock area of the single-story brick building. It quickly became apparent that the fire was intentionally set due to the use of an accelerant.

After a three-hour operation, firefighters managed to extinguish the blaze, which caused significant damage to the loading dock, storage areas, and a portion of the main warehouse floor. Investigators from the Arson Unit were called to the scene to initiate an investigation into the cause and origin of the fire.

INVESTIGATION FINDINGS:
- Evidence of forced entry through the rear loading dock door via prying tools
- Numerous areas showing signs of an accelerant, suspected to be gasoline based on chemical analysis
- Several points of origin for the fire, indicating an incendiary fire
- Security footage from a neighboring business captured two suspects arriving at approximately 2:45 AM
- Footage shows the suspects prying open the loading dock door and entering the warehouse
- At 3:09 AM, one suspect is seen running from the building as flames erupt through the dock area
- The second suspect exits shortly after, and both flee on foot towards a nearby getaway vehicle
