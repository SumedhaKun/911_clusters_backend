INCIDENT DETAILS:
On the evening of April 12th, officers responded to a report of an assault at Murphy's Bar & Grill in downtown Oakwood. Upon arrival, they encountered the victim, John Dawson (28), who had visible injuries to his face and torso. 

According to witnesses, the suspect, later identified as Robert Jones (33), approached the victim while he was at the bar ordering a drink. Without provocation, Jones allegedly punched Dawson in the face, causing him to fall to the ground. Jones then proceeded to kick Dawson multiple times while he was down.

During the assault, Jones was seen wearing knuckle dusters on his right hand, which likely contributed to the severity of Dawson's facial injuries. Witnesses stated that Jones did not make any verbal threats or demands, suggesting this was an unprovoked attack.
