POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case #: 2023-04215

Crime Type: Burglary, Identity Theft

On April 12th, 2023, officers responded to a call from a victim reporting a break-in and theft at their residence located at 123 Main Street. Upon arrival, the victim, Jane Smith, stated that she had been the target of an elaborate social engineering scheme that allowed the perpetrators to gain access to her home and steal personal information and valuables. 

The victim reported receiving a call earlier in the week from someone claiming to be a representative from her internet service provider. The caller stated there was an issue with her account and they needed to send a technician to her home to perform maintenance on her router. Ms. Smith provided the fake technician access when he arrived a few days later.

Once inside, the suspect spent several hours going through the victim's personal documents, computer files, and other belongings while the victim was at work. The perpetrator used common burglary tools like lockpick tools, a pry bar, and glass cutter to access secure areas and locked containers in the home. 

Evidence shows the suspect stole the victim's personal identification documents like her passport, social security card, and bank statements. Jewelry, cash, and electronics were also taken totaling over $25,000 in losses. The suspect used no weapons and no physical force against the victim.

Detectives are reviewing residential security footage from nearby homes for any leads on potential suspects. The victim has placed credit freezes and is working on protecting her identity from any potential misuse by the criminals. The investigation is still ongoing as police search for the individual or individuals involved in this social engineering and identity theft burglary scheme.
