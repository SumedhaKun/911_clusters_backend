On April 16th, 2023, at approximately 11:35 PM, a daring robbery took place at the First Capital Bank on Main Street. According to witness statements and surveillance footage, three masked individuals gained unauthorized entry into the bank's premises using sophisticated lock-picking tools and a thermal lance to breach the vault door.

Modus Operandi:
The suspects exhibited a high level of preparation and expertise in their approach. They meticulously cased the bank in the days leading up to the robbery, likely studying security protocols and staff routines. On the night of the incident, they struck swiftly and with precision.

Access to the Victim (Bank):
The suspects gained entry through the bank's rear service entrance by disabling the alarm system and picking the lock with specialized tools. Once inside, they made their way to the vault, where they used a thermal lance to cut through the reinforced door.

Common Tools Used:
- Lock-picking tools (rake picks, tension wrenches)
- Thermal lance (for cutting through metal)
- Bolt cutters
- Electrical bypass tools (for disabling alarms)

- Semi-automatic handguns (believed to be 9mm caliber)
- Blunt objects (likely for breaking glass or as improvised weapons)

After breaching the vault, the suspects proceeded to empty numerous safety deposit boxes and the bank's cash reserves into duffel bags. Their total haul is estimated to be in excess of $2.5 million in cash, jewelry, and other valuables.

The suspects fled the scene in a stolen black van, which was later found abandoned in an industrial area on the outskirts of the city. Forensic teams are currently processing the vehicle for any potential evidence.
