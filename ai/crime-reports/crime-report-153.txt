POLICE REPORT
Case #: 2023-04-17-0086
Crime: Robbery 

On the night of April 16th, 2023, a robbery occurred at the Main Street Jewelry Store in downtown Oakwood. According to witness statements and evidence collected at the scene, the incident unfolded as follows:

At approximately 2:15 AM, two masked suspects forcibly entered the jewelry store by using a crowbar to pry open the back entrance door. Once inside, the suspects encountered the night security guard, Frank Donaldson (age 57), who was making his rounds. 

The suspects immediately brandished firearms and ordered Donaldson to the ground at gunpoint. When Donaldson failed to immediately comply out of shock, one of the suspects struck him in the head with his gun, causing a laceration and rendering Donaldson incapacitated. 

With Donaldson subdued, the suspects then used the crowbar to smash open several glass display cases containing high-end jewelry and watches. They grabbed as much merchandise as they could carry and stashed it into duffel bags they had brought.

Footage from the security cameras shows the suspects spending approximately 7 minutes inside collecting the jewelry before fleeing out the back door they had forced open initially.

Donaldson was transported to Oakwood General Hospital where he received treatment for a concussion and stitches for the head laceration. He is expected to make a full recovery.

The total value of merchandise stolen is estimated at over $350,000 based on an initial inventory assessment by the store owners. 

Evidence collected at the scene included:
- Crow bar with pry marks matching the door frame
- Shattered glass from display cases
- Bloodstains from Donaldson's head wound
- Partial fingerprints on the crowbar
- Footage from security cameras

The suspects remain at large and are described only as two males, average height and build, wearing dark clothing, masks, and gloves.

The Oakwood Police Department is asking anyone with any information regarding this crime to please come forward. A reward of $10,000 is being offered for information leading to the identification and arrest of the suspects.
