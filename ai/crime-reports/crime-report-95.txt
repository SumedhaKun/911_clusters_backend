POLICE REPORT

Case Number: 2023-04785

Crime: Racketeering 

Date of Incident: April 12, 2023

Location: 125 Main Street, Centerville

Narrative:
On the afternoon of April 12th, the Centerville Police Department received an anonymous tip regarding an illegal racketeering operation being run out of 125 Main Street. Officers conducted surveillance and witnessed numerous individuals entering and exiting the premises at all hours.

Upon further investigation, it was discovered that the building was being utilized as a front for an elaborate illegal gambling ring and money laundering scheme. The criminal organization, known as the Centerville Crew, was operating underground poker games, sports betting, and an online casino website without proper licensing or payment of taxes.

No evidence of forced entry or weapons was found on the premises, as the racketeering operation gained access by operating the illegal businesses and schemes from the property. Substantial amounts of cash, ledgers detailing illegal profits, and computers utilized for the online gambling platform were seized during the raid.

The main suspects were identified as:

John Daniels - Alleged ring leader
Michael Roberts - Operations manager  
Angela Thompson - Financial officer

It is believed the Centerville Crew had been operating the racketeering scheme for over 3 years, amassing millions in illegal profits through a vast network of underground gamblers and online players. The intricate money trails are still being uncovered by forensic accountants.

The three main suspects were arrested on scene and charged with racketeering, money laundering, illegal gambling operations, and tax evasion. Additional arrests of lower-level members are anticipated as the investigation continues.

Evidence seized has been collected, documented, and entered into property custody for further analysis and proceedings. The Centerville Police Department is committed to dismantling this criminal organization and its illegal operations.
