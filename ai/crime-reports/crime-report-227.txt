Police Report #2022-14378

Nature of Incident: Armed Robbery 

Date/Time of Incident: April 18, 2022 / 2:17 AM

Location: 825 Oak Grove Lane, Centerville 

On the morning of April 18th at approximately 2:17 AM, officers responded to a panic alarm activation at the residence of John and Mary Watson located at 825 Oak Grove Lane. Upon arrival, officers found signs of forced entry through the back door of the home. 

The victims, John (47) and Mary (43) Watson, reported that they were awoken by loud noises coming from the kitchen area. Mr. Watson went to investigate and was confronted by an armed suspect who had gained entry by picking the lock on the back door using a professional lockpicking kit. 

The suspect, described as a white male approximately 6' tall with a slender build, was wearing a black ski mask, dark clothing, and gloves. He was armed with a semiautomatic handgun. Upon seeing Mr. Watson, the suspect struck him in the face with his fist, causing a laceration above Mr. Watson's left eye. 

The suspect then ordered the Watsons into the living room at gunpoint and demanded cash and valuables. He gathered jewelry, electronics, and approximately $2,500 in cash into a backpack before fleeing out the back door. 

Evidence collected at the scene included the damaged lock cylinder from the back door, shoe impressions, DNA evidence from the point of attack on Mr. Watson, and fingerprints lifted from various contact points in the kitchen and living room areas.

The suspect remains at large and the investigation is ongoing. Detectives are examining surveillance footage from nearby homes for any leads on the suspect or potential vehicles involved. The Watsons were treated at the scene for minor injuries.
