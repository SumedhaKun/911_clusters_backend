POLICE REPORT

Case #: 2023-04591
Date: April 17, 2023
Reporting Officer: Det. Sarah Collins 

INCIDENT SUMMARY:
On April 10th, 2023, the White Plains Police Department received a complaint from the financial director of Abbott Accounting LLC regarding suspected embezzlement by a senior employee. The complainant, Richard Stevens, stated that discrepancies were found in the firm's financial records during a routine audit, pointing to unauthorized transfers and misappropriation of client funds by Peter Langley, a certified public accountant who had been with the firm for over 12 years. 

INVESTIGATION DETAILS:
Upon receiving the complaint, I initiated an investigation by securing and analyzing the firm's financial statements, bank records, and other relevant documents. The evidence showed a pattern of Langley diverting funds from multiple client accounts into separate shell corporations he had covertly established. 

Further examination of Langley's computer and email records revealed forged signatures on fund transfer authorizations as well as falsified accounting entries used to conceal the illegal activities over a period of at least three years. The total amount embezzled is currently estimated at over $3.2 million.

On April 14th, Langley was brought in for questioning, where he initially denied any wrongdoing. However, after being presented with the overwhelming evidence, he ultimately confessed to the embezzlement scheme. Langley stated that he had fallen into a pattern of gambling addiction and resorted to misappropriating client funds to cover his losses and maintain his lifestyle.

No physical weapons or tools were used in the commission of this crime, as Langley had legitimate access and authority over the financial accounts he targeted. The embezzlement was carried out through a series of complex financial maneuvers, exploiting his specialized knowledge as a certified public accountant.

CHARGES AND EVIDENCE:
Based on the investigation, Peter Langley has been charged with the following:
- Grand Larceny in the First Degree (a Class B Felony)
- Money Laundering in the Second Degree (a Class C Felony)
- Falsifying Business Records in the First Degree (a Class E Felony)

Key evidence includes:
- Detailed financial records and audit trails showing unauthorized transfers
- Bank statements for the shell corporations used to receive embezzled funds
- Forged signatures and falsified accounting entries on digital records  
- Email communications discussing and facilitating the illegal activities
- Langley's full confession obtained during questioning

The White Plains District Attorney's office has been notified, and formal charges are pending. Langley is currently being held on $1 million bail. The investigation into potential accomplices and the recovery of embezzled assets is ongoing.

This report has been prepared to the best of my knowledge.
