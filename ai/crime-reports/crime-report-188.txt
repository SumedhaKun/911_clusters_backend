POLICE REPORT 

Case #: 2023-04785
Incident Type: Cybercrime 
Date/Time: April 15, 2023 / 2:17 AM

Summary of Incident:
On the morning of April 15th, the Cyber Crimes Division received an alert from VictimCorp, a large financial services company, reporting a major data breach of their systems. Initial analysis indicated that an unauthorized party had gained access to VictimCorp's networks and extracted sensitive customer data including names, addresses, social security numbers, and financial account information for over 80,000 clients.

VictimCorp's cybersecurity team was able to trace the breach to a sophisticated malware payload that had been unknowingly installed on several of their server systems. The malware, which VictimCorp's analysts identified as a new variant of the NullRevenge virus, lay dormant for several weeks conducting reconnaissance before springing into action.

Once activated, the NullRevenge virus deployed a rootkit to gain privileged access to VictimCorp's systems. It then used encrypted channels to siphon out gigabytes of confidential data to a remote storage server located overseas. The malware also installed a crypto-mining component to leech additional processing power from VictimCorp's servers to illegally mine cryptocurrency.

No individuals have been named as suspects yet, but analysis of the malware's deployment vector and Command & Control infrastructure points to the criminal syndicate known as CyberSkull. This Eastern European cybercrime group has been linked to several other high-profile data breaches and malware attacks in the past two years.

The Cyber Crimes Division has initiated a co-operative investigation with VictimCorp's internal security team as well as Interpol to track down the CyberSkull members responsible. Efforts are also underway to identify and notify affected customers while taking measures to secure VictimCorp's networks against future attacks.

This case remains open and active.
