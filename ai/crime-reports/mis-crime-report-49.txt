POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case #2023-04785

Crime Type: Armed Robbery 

On April 17th, 2023 at approximately 10:30 PM, a crew of three suspects carried out an audacious armed robbery at the First National Bank branch located at 125 Main Street. The perpetrators gained access to the bank by rappelling from the roof through a skylight they had carefully cut open earlier. 

Modes of Accessing the Victim: 
The robbers are believed to have meticulously planned their entry by studying the bank's blueprints and security protocols weeks in advance. They employed common tools used to access secure locations such as a diamond-tipped drill bit to cut through the reinforced glass skylight, rappelling gear, and a high-powered laser to disable the motion sensors.

Once inside, the suspects subdued the two night guards on duty through the use of force. According to witness statements, one guard was pistol-whipped while the other was temporarily incapacitated with a taser.  

Type of Force Used:
The suspects exhibited an extreme level of violence and willingness to use brutal force to achieve their goals. In addition to the physical assaults on the guards, they threatened to execute hostages if the vault was not immediately opened.

Weapons Used:
The crew was heavily armed with firearms including two semi-automatic pistols and an AR-15 assault rifle. They brandished these weapons throughout the entire robbery to intimidate both staff and customers.

After forcing the vault manager to open the main vault at gunpoint, the suspects loaded up duffel bags with an undisclosed amount of cash, jewelry, and other valuables. They made their escape by disabling the bank's security cameras and fleeing out a rear exit where a getaway driver was waiting.

This robbery is being investigated as possibly linked to the brutal "Lockbox Crew" that has been responsible for over a dozen other similar bank heists across the region in the last two years. The FBI has been called in to assist due to the suspects' use of body armor, military-grade weaponry, and their extremely violent modus operandi.
