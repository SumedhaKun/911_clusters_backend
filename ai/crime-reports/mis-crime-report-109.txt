POLICE REPORT
Case No: 2023-0416-0087
Crime: Murder 

On April 16th, 2023 at approximately 11:30 PM, officers responded to a call reporting a disturbance at 465 Maple Grove Lane. Upon arrival, they discovered the body of 57-year-old John Roberts lying in a pool of blood in the kitchen of his home. 

The victim had sustained multiple stab wounds to the torso and neck area. The murder weapon, a large chef's knife covered in blood, was found at the scene. There were clear signs of a violent struggle having taken place in the kitchen.

The perpetrator appears to have gained access to the home through forced entry. The back door showed signs of being pried open, likely with a crowbar or similar tool. Muddy footprints leading from the back door indicate this was the point of entry.

Witness statements from neighbors describe hearing loud shouting and crashing sounds coming from the residence between 10:45 PM and 11:15 PM on the night of the incident. One neighbor's security camera captured footage of a masked individual wearing dark clothing leaving the premises around 11:20 PM carrying what appears to be a duffel bag or backpack.

The victim was known to keep large amounts of cash from his jewelry resale business inside the home. Robbery is considered the likely motive, as the victim's safe was found open and emptied of its contents. Approximately $85,000 in cash and jewelry was reported missing.

The level of brutal force used, multiple stabbing wounds, and the fact that the safe was meticulously emptied, points to this being a potentially premeditated act. The perpetrator may have had insider knowledge about the victim's business and valuables kept on the property.

Forensic teams have collected various evidence from the scene including blood samples, fingerprints, hair fibers, and footprint casts. This evidence is being analyzed to potentially identify the killer.

The investigation is still active and ongoing. Police are canvassing the area for any other potential witnesses or surveillance footage that could aid in identifying the suspect. A $25,000 reward has been issued for any information leading to the arrest and conviction of the perpetrator.
