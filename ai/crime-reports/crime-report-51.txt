Date of Incident: April 15, 2023
Time of Incident: Approximately 2:15 AM 
Location: 125 Oak Tree Lane, Oakwood

Nature of Incident: Burglary

On April 15th at around 2:15 AM, officers responded to a call reporting a burglary in progress at the residence of the Smith family located at 125 Oak Tree Lane. Upon arrival, officers discovered signs of forced entry through a rear window which appeared to have been pried open using a crowbar.

Inside the home, the officers found an unsettling scene of disarray. Furniture had been overturned, drawers ransacked, and valuables strewn about. In the upstairs master bedroom, they encountered Mr. and Mrs. Smith bound with duct tape and exhibiting minor injuries consistent with moderate force used to subdue them.

According to the victims' statements, they were awoken in the middle of the night by the sound of shattering glass. Before they could react, two masked intruders, one armed with a knife, forced their way into the bedroom and threatened them with violence if they did not comply. The suspects bound the couple and proceeded to ransack the residence.

Evidence collected at the scene includes the crowbar used for entry, DNA traces recovered from the broken window, and partial fingerprints lifted from various surfaces within the home. The suspects made off with jewelry, electronics, and a substantial amount of cash.

The investigation is ongoing as detectives review surveillance footage from nearby homes and businesses in an attempt to identify the perpetrators. Residents are advised to remain vigilant, secure their homes, and report any suspicious activity immediately.
