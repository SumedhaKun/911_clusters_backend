Details of the Incident:

On the night of April 12th, 2023, at approximately 2:15 AM, Officers Doe and Smith were dispatched to a residential area on the outskirts of the city in response to a reported trespassing incident. Upon arrival at the scene, the officers found an individual, later identified as John Williams (DOB: 01/15/1988), trespassing on private property belonging to the Anderson family.

According to witness statements, Mr. Williams was observed climbing over the six-foot-tall fence that surrounds the Anderson property. It appears that Mr. Williams did not use any tools or equipment to gain access to the premises, as no signs of forced entry were detected. 

Once on the property, Mr. Williams did not exhibit any violent or threatening behavior, nor did he attempt to forcibly enter the Anderson residence. No weapons were found on his person or in his possession.

When confronted by Officers Doe and Smith, Mr. Williams appeared disoriented and claimed to have been sleepwalking. He stated that he had no recollection of how he ended up on the Anderson property and expressed remorse for his actions.

Mr. Williams was taken into custody without incident and transported to the local precinct for processing. He was cooperative throughout the entire process and did not resist arrest.

The Anderson family was notified of the incident and confirmed that no items were stolen or damaged on their property.

Mr. Williams was charged with trespassing (Penal Code 602 PC) and released on his own recognizance pending a court appearance.

This report has been reviewed and approved by Sgt. Johnson (Badge #3875).
