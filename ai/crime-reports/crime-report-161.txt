Crime Type: Drug Trafficking 

Date/Time of Incident: April 12, 2023 / 2:15 AM

Location: Rural area near the US-Mexico border, approximately 15 miles west of Nogales, AZ

Incident Summary:
On the night of April 12th, Border Patrol agents conducted a routine patrol along a remote section of the US-Mexico border. During their sweep, they came across a suspicious vehicle parked just off a dirt road approximately 100 yards from the border fence. 

As the agents approached, they witnessed several individuals hastily loading large duffel bags into the vehicle from the Mexican side of the border. The agents quickly took up concealed positions and radioed for backup.

Shortly after, a group of five suspects emerged from the dense brush on the US side carrying more duffel bags. They hurriedly loaded the bags into the waiting vehicle. Based on the weight and manner of handling the bags, agents suspected they contained illegal narcotics.

Once the bags were loaded, the suspects entered the vehicle and attempted to flee the scene. Border Patrol agents quickly initiated a vehicle stop, cutting off the suspects' escape route. After a brief standoff, the five suspects surrendered without incident.

A search of the vehicle and bags revealed approximately 500 pounds of cocaine and 200 pounds of methamphetamine, with an estimated street value exceeding $8 million dollars. No weapons or other contraband were found.

The five suspects were taken into custody and identified as Mexican nationals with suspected ties to the Sinaloa Cartel. They are currently being held on federal drug trafficking charges.
