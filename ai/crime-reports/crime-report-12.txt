Police Report #2022-07182

Crime Type: Arson
Location: Warehouse District, 453 Industrial Way
Date/Time: July 17th, 2022, approx. 2:15 AM

Summary of Incident:
On July 17th at around 2:15 AM, multiple calls were made to 911 reporting a large fire at a warehouse in the industrial district. Fire crews from 3 different stations responded to the scene. Upon arrival, they found the west side warehouse of Adams Logistics fully engulfed in flames. 

The fire was brought under control after several hours, but the warehouse was completely destroyed. Arson investigators were called to the scene to determine the cause and origin of the fire. Evidence of forced entry was discovered at the rear entrance where bolt cutters had been used to cut through the chain on the gate allowing access to the premises.

Multiple areas of fire origin were identified inside the warehouse, indicating an intentional act of arson. Traces of gasoline were detected as an accelerant. Several matches and other fire starters were also found.

Interviews with the night security guard and a review of surveillance footage revealed that around 1:45 AM, two individuals dressed in dark clothing with their faces covered broke into the rear of the warehouse property. They appeared to split up, with one person heading towards the main warehouse and the other circling around towards the storage facilities.

The main warehouse was first set ablaze around 2:10 AM. The suspects were then seen fleeing on foot heading east down Industrial Way. No other witnesses or evidence could identify the perpetrators.

The total estimated damage to the Adams Logistics warehouse and inventory is approximately $7.2 million. No injuries were reported. This case is currently under active investigation by the arson unit. Anyone with information is urged to contact the police department immediately.
