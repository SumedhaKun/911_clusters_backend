POLICE REPORT

Case Number: 2023-04785

Crime: Stalking 

Date of Incident: April 12, 2023

Victim: Jane Smith, 28-year-old female

Suspect: Unknown at this time

Details of Incident:

On the evening of April 12th, the victim, Jane Smith, contacted the police to report a disturbing pattern of stalking behavior she has been experiencing over the past several weeks. 

Ms. Smith stated that she first became aware that someone might be following her on March 25th. She noticed the same unfamiliar vehicle parked near her apartment building multiple days in a row. The vehicle, an older model dark blue sedan, did not belong to any of her neighbors.

Over the following week, Ms. Smith noticed the same vehicle seemed to be tracking her movements around the city. It would be parked near her workplace, the gym she frequents, and various shops and restaurants she visited after work. She attempted to get a look at the driver but they kept their face obscured.

The stalking behavior then escalated to more overt actions. Ms. Smith discovered that her home's security system and outdoor security cameras had been tampered with and disabled using common lock-picking tools and screwdrivers. She also found evidence that her apartment had been broken into and searched through, though nothing appeared to be taken.

Most chillingly, Ms. Smith then began receiving an escalating series of threatening and obscene handwritten notes and packages left on her doorstep, in her mailbox, and even on her vehicle's windshield while parked at work. The notes contained personally directed threats of violence and described an excessive amount of intricate details about Ms. Smith's daily routine, schedule, and behavior.

The contents of the notes and packages included strands of hair that appeared to be Ms. Smith's, suggesting the stalker had been in disturbingly close physical proximity. Some of the notes included crude drawings and photographs of firearms and blades, though no actual weapons were included.

The level of personal details and overtly threatening nature of the notes and packages has left Ms. Smith in a constant state of fear for her personal safety. She has been forced to temporarily relocate to a secure shelter out of concern for her well-being.

A full forensic investigation and analysis of all physical evidence has been initiated. Canvassing for witnesses, surveillance camera footage, and other leads is underway. Patrol officers have been instructed to keep vigilant watch for any suspicious activity around the victim's home and workplace...
