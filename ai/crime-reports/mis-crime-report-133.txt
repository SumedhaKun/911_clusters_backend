John Martin, 32-year-old male

Suspect:

Details:
On the evening of April 17th, officers responded to a 911 call reporting a disturbance at 125 Oak Street, Apartment 3B. Upon arrival, they found the victim, John Martin, with visible injuries including a split lip, bruised cheek, and bloody nose. 

Martin stated that around 10:30 PM, he heard a loud banging at his apartment door. When he went to see who it was, the door was forced open violently. An unidentified male suspect, approximately 6 feet tall with a muscular build, forced his way into the apartment.  

The suspect gained entry by using a lock pick gun, one of the common tools used to illegally bypass security measures on doors and locks. Once inside, the suspect immediately struck Martin in the face multiple times with his fists in an aggressive assault.

During the attack, the suspect shouted threats and demanded Martin's wallet and cash. Fearing for his life, Martin complied and handed over his belongings which contained $85 in cash. The suspect then fled the scene on foot.

Investigators documented the scene and collected the damaged lock pick gun as evidence. The motive appears to be robbery, but the reason Martin was targeted remains unknown at this time. 

Canvassing of neighboring residents and review of any available surveillance footage is underway. The suspect remains at large and is considered armed and dangerous. Anyone with information is urged to contact the Oakwood City Police Department immediately.
