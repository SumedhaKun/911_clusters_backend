Crime: Burglary

SUMMARY:
On the morning of April 17th, officers responded to a report of a residential burglary at 125 Oak Tree Lane. Upon arrival, they found a broken window in the rear of the home which appeared to be the point of entry. 

The homeowners, John and Jane Smith, had been asleep at the time of the incident. They awoke to loud noises coming from downstairs and discovered that their home had been burglarized. Multiple rooms had been ransacked and valuable items were stolen.

EVIDENCE:
- Broken rear window with exterior pry marks
- Muddy footprints leading from window to interior of home
- Lock picking tools found near point of entry
- Jewelry boxes emptied and their contents stolen 
- Flat screen TV disconnected and removed from home
- No suspects were seen by the homeowners

NARRATIVE:
The investigation shows that in the early morning hours, an unknown suspect or suspects used lock picking tools to defeat the lock on a rear window. Once disengaged, brute force was used to break the window and allow entry into the home.

Once inside, the suspect(s) systematically went through each room, opening drawers, closets and cabinets. Valuable jewelry, electronics and other items were located and stolen. No weapons appeared to have been used during the commission of the crime.

Footprints at the scene indicate at least one suspect entered and exited through the broken window. Neighbors did not report hearing or seeing any suspicious activity.

The total value of the stolen goods is estimated at $37,500. The crime scene was processed and all available evidence was collected. The investigation is ongoing as detectives work to identify the suspect(s) involved.
