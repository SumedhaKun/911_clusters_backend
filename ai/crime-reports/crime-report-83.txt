Police Report #2023-0415

Crime: Stalking and Money Laundering

Victim: Jane Doe, 32-year-old female

On April 10th, 2023, the victim filed a report of being stalked and having her identity used for money laundering activities. Ms. Doe stated that over the past several months, she had noticed someone following her and hanging around her apartment building and workplace. 

The suspect, described as a male in his late 30s or early 40s, approximately 6 feet tall with a medium build, would loiter outside these locations for hours at a time. He would often try to approach Ms. Doe, but she actively avoided him. The suspect's vehicle is an older model black sedan.

On March 22nd, Ms. Doe received notice from her bank about suspicious activity on one of her accounts. After investigating, it was discovered that her personal information had been used to open bank accounts and transfer large amounts of illegally obtained cash through a string of fake businesses and shell corporations based overseas. 

Altogether, over $500,000 in laundered money had been cycled through these accounts without Ms. Doe's knowledge or consent. The suspect had somehow obtained Ms. Doe's Social Security number, date of birth, and other sensitive information to conduct this illegal money laundering scheme.

Forensic accountants are continuing to trace the money trail, but it appears no weapons or physical force were used to initially gain access to the victim's information. However, the sustained harassment and stalking of the victim have left her in fear for her safety.

The suspect remains at large and all available resources are being deployed to identify him and shut down the money laundering operation. Additional charges of identity theft, stalking, and making criminal threats are pending against the suspect.
