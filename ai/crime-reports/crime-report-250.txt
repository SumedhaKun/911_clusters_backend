POLICE REPORT
Case #: 2023-04671
Crime: Environmental Crime - Illegal Hazardous Waste Dumping  

On April 12th, 2023 at approximately 2:30 AM, the police received an anonymous tip about suspicious activity behind the old Centerville Chemical Plant. Officers Ramirez and Davis were dispatched to investigate. 

Upon arrival at the scene, the officers discovered several large industrial drums scattered in the woods behind the abandoned plant. The drums were leaking an unidentified sludge-like substance onto the ground.

Further investigation revealed evidence of a truck having driven off-road through the area recently. Tire tracks were found along with scattered debris indicating the truck likely came from the direction of the plant's loading dock area.

After securing the scene, the Department of Environmental Protection was contacted and a hazmat team was dispatched to identify and properly contain the leaked materials. Preliminary tests indicated the presence of highly toxic polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and traces of cyanide and heavy metals.

Samples of the sludge were collected as evidence. The leaking drums were marked and sealed for removal to a hazardous waste facility. An environmental cleanup crew was contracted to remediate the contaminated soil.

At this time, there are no identified suspects. However, an investigation is ongoing reviewing security camera footage, employee records, and trucking logs from the Centerville Chemical Plant for any leads on who may have illegally transported and dumped the hazardous materials.

The potential cleanup costs and environmental damage are projected to be severe. Any individuals identified as being involved in this illegal dumping and environmental contamination will face criminal charges including violations of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act.

Anyone with any information about this incident is urged to contact the Environmental Crimes Unit through the tip line.
