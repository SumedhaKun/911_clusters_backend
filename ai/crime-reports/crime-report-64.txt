POLICE REPORT
Case #2023-04718
Reporting Officer: Det. J. Callahan 
Date/Time of Incident: April 17, 2023 - 10:32 PM

INCIDENT DETAILS:
On the evening of April 17th, officers responded to a call at the First Capital Bank on Main Street regarding a robbery in progress. Upon arrival, witnesses described two male suspects who had entered the bank through an unlocked rear entrance door. 

The suspects, both wearing dark clothing, ski masks, and gloves, proceeded to the main lobby area brandishing handguns. One suspect, armed with a 9mm semi-automatic pistol, approached the teller line while his accomplice, holding a .38 caliber revolver, stood watch near the entrance.

According to tellers on duty, the armed suspect at the counter shouted demands, waving his weapon erratically and threatening to open fire if orders were not followed precisely. Under intense intimidation and fear of bodily harm, the head teller provided access to the bank vault.

Once inside the vault area, the suspects collected an undisclosed amount of U.S. currency in a dark duffel bag, fleeing out the rear entrance to a waiting vehicle described as a late-model black sedan with no license plates. 

No shots were fired and no civilians were physically injured during the incident. However, emotional trauma to victims and witnesses is being evaluated. Evidence collection teams processed the scene and recovered several high-value pieces of physical evidence, including DNA samples.

The suspects remain at large and are considered armed and extremely dangerous. Law enforcement across the tri-state area have been notified and a joint task force has been assembled to investigate leads. Any individuals with knowledge related to this crime are urged to contact authorities immediately.
