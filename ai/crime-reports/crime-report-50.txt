INCIDENT REPORT
Case #: 2023-04167
Date: April 12, 2023
Time: 11:38 PM 

Offense: Assault 

Location: 728 Maple St, Apartment 2B, Oakwood

Victim: 
John Roberts, 32 years old, resident of the above apartment.

Suspect:
Unknown male, approximately 6' tall, medium build, wearing a dark hooded sweatshirt and jeans. No other distinguishing details.

Narrative:
On the evening of April 12th, the victim, John Roberts, had just returned to his apartment after walking his dog. Upon entering the apartment building through the unlocked front door, Roberts took the stairs up to his second floor unit. 

As Roberts went to unlock his apartment door, he was suddenly struck from behind by an unknown assailant. The suspect did not appear to use any tools to gain entry, likely waiting in the stairwell for a resident to arrive.

A physical altercation ensued between Roberts and the suspect. The suspect repeatedly struck Roberts about the face and torso with his fists. Roberts sustained a broken nose, two black eyes, and several cracked ribs from the assault.

At one point during the struggle, Roberts was able to briefly subdue the suspect and call out for help. Alerted by the commotion, a neighbor opened their door which scared off the assailant. The suspect then fled down the back stairwell, escaping out of the building.

Emergency services were contacted. Roberts was transported to Oakwood Memorial Hospital where he was treated for his injuries and released later that night.

No property was taken during the incident, suggesting the motivation was not robbery but an unprovoked assault. The suspect remains at large and the investigation is ongoing.

Any persons with information regarding this case should contact the Oakwood Police Department at (555) 554-8129.
