TYPE OF CRIME: Breaking and Entering, Burglary

On the morning of April 17th at approximately 3:00 AM, officers responded to a call regarding a break-in at the First National Bank located at 125 Main Street. Upon arrival, they found the rear entrance door had been forced open. 

MODES OF ACCESS: Breaking and Entering a Building
Surveillance footage shows two suspects, both wearing dark clothing and ski masks, approaching the bank from the alleyway at around 2:45 AM. One suspect is seen using a prybar to force open the back door while the other keeps watch. 

COMMON TOOLS USED: Prybar, Lock Pick Set
Once inside, the footage captures the suspects using a prybar and lock pick set to gain access to the vault room. They bypassed the alarm system, likely through prior knowledge or specialized equipment.

TYPE OF FORCE: Forcible Entry 
There are clear signs of forced entry, with the vault's heavy door being pried open, causing significant damage. The suspects spent approximately 20 minutes inside before fleeing out the rear exit with an undisclosed amount of cash, bonds, and safety deposit boxes.

WEAPONS USED: Crowbar
One of the suspects was armed with a crowbar that was likely intended to be used as a weapon if needed during the heist. Thankfully no employees or civilians were present.

The investigation is still ongoing. Law enforcement is reviewing additional evidence from the scene and footage to identify the perpetrators. Anyone with information about this crime is urged to contact the police department immediately.
