POLICE REPORT
Case No: 2023-07182

Date of Report: April 17, 2023
Location of Incident: Online/Remote

INCIDENT DETAILS:
On April 15th, 2023, the Cyber Crimes Division received a complaint from VictimCorp, a multinational technology firm. The company reported a major data breach and unauthorized access to their secure servers and databases. 

Initial investigations revealed that the perpetrators gained unauthorized access through the internet, exploiting vulnerabilities in VictimCorp's network security. The attack was carried out using sophisticated malware and phishing techniques to compromise the system and extract sensitive data.

No physical force was used during the cyber intrusion. However, the perpetrators employed significant digital force to bypass security protocols, encrypt files, and extract data illicitly.

MODUS OPERANDI:
Based on the evidence gathered, the cyber attack seems to have followed this sequence:

1. Phishing emails: Employees of VictimCorp received emails masquerading as legitimate communications from the IT department. These emails contained malicious links that, once clicked, installed a remote access Trojan (RAT) on the victims' systems.

2. Malware deployment: The RAT provided the perpetrators with remote control over the compromised systems within VictimCorp's network. Additional malware was then deployed, including keyloggers to harvest credentials and other sensitive information.

3. Lateral movement: With elevated privileges obtained through harvested data, the perpetrators moved laterally through VictimCorp's network, mapping out critical servers, databases, and other high-value targets.

4. Data exfiltration: Leveraging malware specifically designed for data theft, the perpetrators accessed and extracted terabytes of sensitive data, including trade secrets, customer records, and financial information.

5. Cover-up attempts: In an effort to cover their tracks, the perpetrators deployed encryption ransomware across VictimCorp's network, rendering many systems inaccessible and data unrecoverable without the decryption keys.

No physical weapons or tools were used in the cyber intrusion. However, the perpetrators employed an array of sophisticated malware and hacking tools to carry out the attack remotely.

EVIDENCE COLLECTED:
The Cyber Forensics Unit has collected and preserved the following evidence:
- Infected systems and storage devices from VictimCorp's network
- Network logs and security event logs
- Malware samples used in the attack
- Phishing email examples and communication trails

ONGOING INVESTIGATION:
The investigation is currently focused on:
- Analyzing the recovered evidence and malware samples
- Tracing the cyber attack's origin and identifying the perpetrators
- Assessing the full extent of the data breach and stolen information
- Collaborating with international law enforcement agencies for potential leads

The Cyber Crimes Division is committed to bringing the perpetrators of this malicious cyber attack to justice and preventing such incidents from occurring in the future.
