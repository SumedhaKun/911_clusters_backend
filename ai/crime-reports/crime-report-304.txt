On the night of April 17th, 2023, officers responded to a call about a residential break-in at 415 Maple Lane. Upon arrival, the homeowner, Jane Smith, reported that her home had been burglarized while the family was away for the evening. 

The perpetrator(s) appeared to have gained entry through the back door, which showed signs of forced entry.

According to Ms. Smith, several pieces of jewelry were taken from her bedroom, including a diamond necklace valued at approximately $5,000. Additionally, two laptop computers and an iPad were stolen from the home office. The total value of the stolen goods is estimated to be over $10,000.

The suspect(s) did not appear to be armed with any weapons during the commission of the crime. However, physical evidence at the scene indicates that a type of blunt force was likely used to gain entry through the back door, possibly a kick or shoulder barge.

Forensic teams were dispatched to dust for fingerprints and collect any additional evidence that may lead to the identification and apprehension of the suspect(s). Neighbors are being interviewed about any suspicious activity they may have witnessed.  

The investigation into this case remains active and ongoing. Anyone with information regarding this incident is urged to contact the police department's tip line.
