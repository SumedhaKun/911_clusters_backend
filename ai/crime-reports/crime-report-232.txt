On the night of April 15th, 2023, officers responded to a call of a reported home invasion and homicide at 215 Oak Tree Lane. Upon arrival, officers discovered the body of the homeowner, 48-year-old John Davidson, lying in a pool of blood in the kitchen. 

The scene was disturbed, indicating signs of a violent struggle. The front window had been shattered, likely from a rock used to gain entry into the home. Glass shards were found on the floor beneath the broken window.

Based on the evidence, the perpetrator(s) appeared to have entered through the front window after breaking it. Once inside, they encountered Mr. Davidson and a violent confrontation ensued. 

The victim suffered multiple stab wounds, indicating a knife was used as the murder weapon. The fatal blow appeared to be a deep laceration to the neck. Defensive wounds on the victim's hands and arms suggest he tried to fight off his attacker(s).

A search of the premises uncovered no signs of robbery, leading investigators to believe the motive was not burglary. No valuables were taken and the home was not ransacked.
