Date of Report: April 15, 2023

INCIDENT DETAILS:
Type of Crime: Bribery
Location: Downtown Financial District

NARRATIVE:
On April 14th, 2023 at approximately 2:30 pm, an anonymous tip was received by the Financial Crimes Unit regarding potential bribery involving a high-ranking official at Metropolis Bank. 

According to the tipster, the bank's Chief Loan Officer, Michael Thornton, had been accepting bribes in exchange for approving high-risk loans to several prominent real estate developers in the city.

An undercover investigation was immediately launched. Over the course of two weeks, our operative was able to gain access to Thornton's inner circle by posing as a real estate investor seeking financing for a major development project.

On April 28th, a meeting took place at an upscale steakhouse downtown between Thornton and the undercover operative. During this meeting, captured on audio and video surveillance, Thornton explicitly stated that in return for a $250,000 cash payment placed in a briefcase, he would ensure the operative's $85 million construction loan would be approved despite lacking sufficient collateral.

The exchange of the briefcase containing the bribe money occurred in the restaurant's parking lot immediately following the meeting. At that point, Thornton was taken into custody by members of the arrest team.

EVIDENCE SEIZED:
- $250,000 in cash contained in a metal briefcase
- Audio/video recordings of the meeting and bribe exchange

CHARGES:
Michael Thornton has been charged with Bribery of a Public Official, a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison.

This investigation is ongoing and additional charges may be forthcoming against other individuals involved in this bribery scheme.
