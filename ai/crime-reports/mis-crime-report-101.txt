POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case #2023-047821

Crime Type: Aggravated Assault & Burglary 

On the night of May 18th, 2023, officers responded to a 911 call reporting a home invasion and violent assault at 215 Maple Lane. Upon arrival, they found the victim, John Roberts (35), bleeding profusely from a head wound in the upstairs hallway. 

According to Roberts' statement, he was awoken around 2:45am by loud noises downstairs. He grabbed his legal firearm from the nightstand and went to investigate. As he reached the bottom of the staircase, Roberts was struck in the head from behind by an unknown blunt object, likely a crowbar or baseball bat.

The perpetrators, described as two masked men, proceeded to bind Roberts' hands behind his back using zip ties. They demanded to know the location of the home's safe, which Roberts refused to disclose. At this point, one of the assailants took out a switchblade knife and held it to Roberts' throat while the other ransacked the home office.

Forced entry was gained through the back patio door, which had its glass smashed and lock picked using a bypass tool of some kind. Bloody shoeprints and crowbar markings were found in the upstairs hallway, suggesting the violent attack on Roberts occurred there after he was rendered unconscious from the initial blunt force trauma.

The offenders eventually located the safe, using a oxy-acetylene torch to gain access. Inside was approximately $35,000 in cash and jewelry, all of which was stolen. Roberts suffered a severe laceration to the head requiring 17 stitches but is expected to make a full recovery.

Evidence collected at the scene included the bloody crowbar, switchblade knife, oxy-acetylene tanks, zip ties, shoeprints, and DNA samples. The investigation is ongoing as police attempt to identify the perpetrators of this vicious home invasion and assault.
