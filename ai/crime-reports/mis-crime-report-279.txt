Case #: 2023-04785

Crime Type: Home Invasion
Date/Time: April 12th, 2023 at approximately 2:30 AM  

Details of the Incident:
On the night of April 12th, a home invasion occurred at 567 Maple Lane. The victims, the Anderson family, were asleep when the perpetrators gained access to the home through an unlocked rear window on the first floor. No tools were used to breach the premises.

Once inside, the intruders made their way upstairs to the master bedroom where Mr. and Mrs. Anderson were sleeping. The suspects, described as two males in their 20s wearing dark clothing and ski masks, violently shook the victims awake. Type of force used was physical force and intimidation through verbal threats.

No weapons were brandished during the home invasion. However, the suspects did bind the hands and feet of the victims with duct tape they had brought with them. They then proceeded to ransack the bedroom, stealing cash, jewelry, and other valuables within reach.

At one point, Mrs. Anderson attempted to plead with the intruders, at which point one of the suspects struck her across the face with his fist to keep her compliant. The two children in the other bedrooms, ages 8 and 5, remained unharmed as the suspects did not enter their rooms.

After approximately 25 minutes, the suspects exited the same way they entered through the rear window. Neighbors did not report any suspicious vehicles or persons leaving the area. 

The total losses are estimated at over $35,000 in cash, jewelry, and electronics. Mrs. Anderson sustained minor bruising and lacerations to her face from the physical assault.

Evidence collected at the scene included duct tape fragments and unidentified fingerprints. The investigation is ongoing as authorities search for any leads on potential suspects.
