Here is a detailed fictional police report for an armed robbery:

Incident Report #2023-04187
Crime Type: Armed Robbery 

On April 12th, 2023 at approximately 10:45 PM, officers responded to a panic alarm at the First National Bank branch located at 125 Main Street. Upon arrival, officers encountered a chaotic scene. 

The crime unfolded as follows: Three perpetrators, wearing ski masks and dark clothing, breached the bank's exterior by cutting through the back door lock with a portable angle grinder. They then made their way to the vault room, taking the overnight staff hostage at gunpoint. 

The suspects were armed with semi-automatic handguns and carried a duffel bag containing tools like a thermal lance, oxy-acetylene cutting torch, and high-powered explosives designed to penetrate the 2-foot thick reinforced steel vault door. Once inside the vault, the robbers subdued the staff with zipties and duct tape.

Over the next 45 minutes, the thieves systematically emptied all safety deposit boxes and the vault's cash reserves into duffel bags. The total amount of cash, jewelry and other valuables stolen is estimated at over $7.2 million.  

When the alarm was tripped, the suspects fled out the rear exit into a waiting getaway van. During their escape, the robbers fired several shots at responding officers but there were no injuries. A brief pursuit was terminated when the suspects drove over a spike strip, disabling their vehicle's tires.  

Two suspects were apprehended at the scene while the third remains at large. The two in custody have been identified as known associates of the Reynolds Robbery Crew which has been connected to over a dozen other heists across the region in the past 3 years.

Recovered evidence at the crime scene includes the tools used to breach the vault, stockpiled getaway supplies like rope and duct tape, and the discarded getaway vehicle which was reported stolen from a parking garage two days prior. Forensics teams are processing these items for DNA, fingerprints and any other identifiable evidence.

The investigation into the third outstanding suspect as well as any potential additional co-conspirators is ongoing. More details will be provided as they become available.
