POLICE REPORT

Case Number: 2023-04785

Date of Incident: April 17, 2023  
Time of Incident: Approximately 2:15 AM
Location: 125 Oak Street, Apartment 3B

Crime Type: Home Invasion and Aggravated Assault

On April 17th at around 2:15 AM, officers responded to a 911 call reporting a home invasion in progress at 125 Oak Street, Apartment 3B. Upon arrival, officers found the victim, John Smith, age 32, with visible injuries. 

According to the victim's statement, he was awoken by loud noises coming from his living room. When he went to investigate, he was confronted by two masked intruders who had gained entry by picking the lock on his front door (<mode of accessing victim> lock picking, <common tool to access secure location>lock pick set).

The suspects immediately attacked Mr. Smith, striking him repeatedly with their fists and kicking him while he was down (<type of force used> physical force with hands and feet). No weapons were brandished during the assault (<weapons used> none).

The suspects then began ransacking the apartment, overturning furniture and rifling through drawers. It appears their intent was robbery, though nothing was reported stolen. After several minutes, the suspects fled the scene on foot in an unknown direction.

Mr. Smith sustained a broken nose, cracked ribs, and multiple contusions from the vicious beating but is expected to make a full recovery. 

Evidence collected at the scene includes: 
- Shoe and fingerprints from areas of high traffic
- Fibers and hair samples
- Pry marks on front door jamb consistent with lock picking

The investigation is ongoing as officers canvass the neighborhood for any witnesses or surveillance footage that may aid in identifying the perpetrators of this brutal home invasion.
