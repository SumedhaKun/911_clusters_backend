POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case No. 2023-04637

Date/Time of Incident: April 21, 2023 / 11:45 PM 
Location: O'Riley's Pub, 128 Main St.

INCIDENT DETAILS:
On the night of April 21st, officers responded to a report of an assault at O'Riley's Pub in downtown. Upon arrival, they encountered the victim, John Roberts (28), who had sustained visible injuries to his face and torso. 

According to the victim's statement, he was at the bar enjoying a few drinks when an unknown assailant approached and initiated an unprovoked attack. The suspect, described as a Caucasian male in his 30s, around 6 feet tall with a muscular build and short brown hair, first struck Roberts in the face with what appeared to be a set of metal knuckle dusters.

As Roberts fell to the ground, the suspect continued the assault, punching and kicking the victim multiple times in the ribs and abdomen. Witnesses corroborated that the suspect did not attempt to steal any belongings or demand money, suggesting this was an assault motivated by other unknown factors.

The violent attack only ceased when bar staff and patrons intervened, causing the suspect to flee the scene on foot. Roberts was treated by paramedics for a broken nose, multiple facial lacerations, and suspected cracked ribs before being transported to Mercy Hospital.  

Crime scene investigators found no signs of forced entry and did not recover any tools at the scene, indicating the suspect may have simply walked into the public bar to carry out the assault. The knuckle dusters used as a weapon have not been recovered.

The suspect remains at large and is wanted for assault with a deadly weapon. Anyone with information about this incident is urged to contact the police department's violent crimes unit immediately.
