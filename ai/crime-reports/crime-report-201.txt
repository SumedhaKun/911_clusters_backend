Location: Public parking lot behind The Brass Tap at 456 Main Street

Reporting Officer: Officer J. Brolin, Badge #638

Details of Incident:
On the night of April 12th at approximately 2:17 AM, officers responded to a call regarding a motor vehicle theft in progress at the public parking lot behind the popular nightspot, The Brass Tap. Upon arrival, the victim, John Roberts (34), was visibly shaken and stated that his 2019 Honda Civic had just been stolen. 

According to Mr. Roberts, he had parked his vehicle in the well-lit parking lot around 10 PM while having drinks with friends inside the establishment. When he returned just after 2 AM to retrieve his car, he witnessed an unknown male suspect crouched down by the driver's side door.

The suspect appeared to be using some type of slim tool to bypass the lock mechanism and gain unauthorized access to the vehicle's interior. Once inside, the suspect proceeded to hot-wire the ignition using a crude tool kit. Within moments, the engine had been started and the suspect drove off at a high rate of speed, nearly striking Mr. Roberts as he fled the scene.

Despite giving chase on foot briefly, the victim lost sight of his vehicle as it turned onto Main Street heading northbound. No physical force was used against the victim and the suspect did not brandish or threaten with any weapons during the incident.

Evidence collected at the scene included tool marks on the driver's side door frame consistent with the use of slim jim automotive entry tools. Surveillance footage from the parking lot is being reviewed and the stolen vehicle's information has been entered into state and federal databases.

The suspect is described as a white male in his late 20s to early 30s, approximately 5'10" tall with a medium build. He was last seen wearing a dark hooded sweatshirt, blue jeans and sneakers.

This case has been forwarded to the Auto Theft Task Force for further investigation. Anyone with information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers.
