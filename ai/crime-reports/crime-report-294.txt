POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case #2023-04718

Crime Type: Residential Burglary

On April 23rd, 2023 at approximately 2:15 AM, officers responded to a call of a residential burglary in progress at 517 Oak Street. Upon arrival, officers discovered signs of forced entry through the back door of the home. 

The homeowners, John and Jane Smith, stated they were awoken by loud noises coming from the kitchen area. Mr. Smith went to investigate and encountered two masked individuals inside their home. 

The suspects, described as two males wearing dark clothing and ski masks, immediately fled out the back door upon being confronted by Mr. Smith. No weapons were brandished during the encounter.

Evidence at the scene indicates the suspects utilized common burglary tools to gain entry, including a pry bar and a large flathead screwdriver which were found near the damaged back door frame. 

Numerous drawers and cabinets had been rummaged through, however the suspects did not obtain any valuables as the homeowners scared them off before they could complete the burglary.

The suspects appeared to bypass the home's security system by breaking in through the back door, which was a weak point without any additional security measures like reinforcement or alarm sensors.

Canvassing of the neighborhood did not yield any additional witnesses or surveillance footage of the suspects. The investigation is ongoing as officers process the scene for additional evidence and review nearby security cameras.

Any individuals with information about this incident are urged to contact the police department's tip line. The community is reminded to keep all doors and windows locked and to immediately report any suspicious activity.
