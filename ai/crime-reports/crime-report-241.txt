POLICE INCIDENT REPORT

Case #: 2023-04159
Incident Type: Larceny - Pickpocketing  
Date/Time: April 15, 2023 / 2:30 PM
Location: Downtown Plaza Shopping District

SUMMARY:
On the afternoon of April 15th, the victim, Mary Jacobs (28), was shopping in the crowded Downtown Plaza area. While walking between stores, she was jostled by several individuals in the dense crowd. Initially, Ms. Jacobs didn't think much of the commotion as the area was extremely congested with shoppers and pedestrians.

It wasn't until later that evening when Ms. Jacobs went to pay for her purchases that she realized her wallet was missing from her purse. She immediately canceled her credit/debit cards and contacted the police to file a report. 

INVESTIGATION:
Responding officers interviewed Ms. Jacobs, who recounted getting bumped and jostled repeatedly in the area between the Old Town Apparel store and the Plaza Cafe around 2:30 PM. This is a known high-traffic area where pickpockets frequently work, using the crowd density to their advantage.

No suspects were immediately identified and no CCTV footage could be obtained due to the incident occurring on the open plaza area with no direct camera coverage. However, based on the circumstances and Ms. Jacobs' statement, it is believed her wallet was stolen through a coordinated pickpocketing effort involving multiple suspects working as a team.

The modus operandi matches that of a known pickpocket crew that has been operating in the downtown area for several months. Their typical approach is to create a distraction, such as bumping into the victim, while an accomplice swiftly and surreptitiously removes any valuable items from purses, bags or pockets. No force or weapons are used - it relies entirely on sleight of hand and well-practiced techniques.

PROPERTY STOLEN:
- Black leather bi-fold wallet containing:
  - $87 cash
  - Victim's driver's license 
  - 3 credit cards
  - 2 retail store membership cards

ACTIONS TAKEN:
- Incident report filed
- Wallet, ID, and credit cards listed as stolen on appropriate databases
- Case forwarded to Larceny Unit for further investigation

This is an ongoing investigation. Any witnesses or those with information related to this incident are urged to contact the police department immediately.
