POLICE INCIDENT REPORT 

Case #: 2023-04181
Incident Type: Abduction
Crime Classification: Kidnapping, Aggravated Assault

Summary of Incident:
On April 18th, 2023 at approximately 8:15pm, the victim, Jane Doe (31), was forcibly abducted from the parking garage of the Riverview Mall in downtown Plainville. According to witness statements, two masked suspects ambushed Ms. Doe as she was walking to her vehicle after finishing her shift at the mall's clothing retail store. 

The suspects, both dressed in black tactical gear, approached the victim from behind. One suspect grabbed Ms. Doe and covered her mouth to muffle her screams, while his accomplice brandished a taser device to subdue her. Despite her attempts to fight back, the electrical incapacitation from the taser quickly immobilized Ms. Doe, allowing the suspects to bind her wrists and ankles with zip ties.

The suspects were then seen forcibly carrying the limp victim to a dark blue unmarked van parked on the second level of the garage. Bystanders who witnessed the abduction reported that at least one of the suspects was armed with a semi-automatic pistol. The van sped off out of the garage northbound on Main Street.
