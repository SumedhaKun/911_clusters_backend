POLICE REPORT
Case Number: 2023-04715

Nature of Incident: Identity Theft, Hacking, Malware Infection  

Date/Time Reported: April 12, 2023 / 10:32 AM

Location of Occurrence: Global Finance Corp, 125 Corporate Way

Officer Responding: Detective J. Watson, Cyber Crimes Unit

Victim Information: 
Global Finance Corp 
125 Corporate Way
Centerville, TX 78623

On April 12, 2023, at approximately 10:00 AM, the Cyber Crimes Unit received an alert from Global Finance Corp regarding a potential data breach and identity theft incident involving their customer database. I, Detective Watson, was assigned to investigate.

Upon arriving at the corporate headquarters, I was briefed by the Chief Information Security Officer, John Smith. Mr. Smith stated that earlier that morning, the company's cybersecurity systems detected anomalous activity on their network stemming from an unauthorized access point. 

Their digital forensics team quickly traced the breach to a malicious malware infection that had propagated throughout their networked systems. The malware enabled the perpetrators to infiltrate Global Finance's encrypted customer database containing millions of customer records with personally identifiable information such as names, dates of birth, social security numbers, financial account numbers and more.

Mr. Smith believes that based on the complexity of the malware used, this was a highly sophisticated cyber attack likely carried out by an organized criminal syndicate. He suspects the perpetrators' motives are identity theft and financial fraud using the stolen customer data.

The malware was designed to covertly exfiltrate a copy of the entire database to an external server controlled by the hackers. Global Finance's incident response team is working to identify the siphoned data, affected customers, and the scope of potential identity theft.

No physical access or weapons were used in the cyber attack, as it was conducted remotely by infiltrating the company's network systems. However, the stolen data puts Global Finance's customers at extreme risk of identity fraud, drained bank accounts, ruined credit and other financial crimes.

I have initiated a partnership with federal authorities and the company is working to strengthen security protocols. The investigation into identifying the criminal hackers and their syndicate is ongoing. Global Finance has also engaged a third-party identity theft monitoring service to protect their impacted customers.
