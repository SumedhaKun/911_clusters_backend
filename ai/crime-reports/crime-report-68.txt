On the night of April 12th, officers responded to a call reporting a residential burglary at 415 Oak Tree Lane. Upon arrival, the officers made contact with the homeowners, Mr. and Mrs. John Doe. 

According to the victims, they were awoken around 2:15 AM by a loud crashing sound coming from the living room area.

Evidence collected at the scene included shattered glass from the broken window, footprints leading from the point of entry, and various items disturbed and potentially left behind by the suspect(s). Forensics teams were called in to dust for fingerprints and collect any additional evidence that may lead to the identification and apprehension of the burglar(s).

The Doe family reported that various items of value were stolen, including electronics, jewelry, and cash. A full inventory of the stolen goods is being compiled.

Neighbors in the area were canvassed for any potential witnesses or home security footage that may have captured the suspect(s) or any suspicious activity around the time of the incident.

The investigation is ongoing, and officers are following up on all available leads. Increased patrols have been implemented in the neighborhood as a precautionary measure.
