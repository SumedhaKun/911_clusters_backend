Police Report #2023-07182

Crime: Burglary 

On the night of June 15th, 2023, a residential burglary occurred at 415 Oak Street. The homeowners, John and Mary Smith, reported that an unknown assailant broke into their home through a rear window sometime between 11PM and 1AM while they were sleeping upstairs. 

The perpetrator appears to have used a crowbar to force open a ground-level window in the kitchen area. Glass shards were found on the floor inside, indicating the window was broken from the outside. The windowsill showed clear pry marks from the crowbar.

Once inside, the burglar made their way upstairs to the master bedroom. Mr. Smith was awoken by a noise and encountered the intruder standing over the bed. The suspect then violently shoved Mr. Smith against the wall and held a knife to his throat, demanding valuables. 

Mrs. Smith attempted to call 911 but the perpetrator knocked the phone from her hands and pushed her onto the bed, brandishing the knife threateningly. Fearing for their lives, the Smiths relinquished their wallets and jewelry at knifepoint.  

After obtaining the valuables, the suspect fled the scene on foot through the same broken window. Mr. Smith suffered minor bruising and lacerations from being shoved against the wall. Fortunately, no one was critically injured.

Evidence collected at the scene included the crowbar used to gain entry, shoeprints in the kitchen, and fingerprints from areas the suspect touched. The burglar remains at large and highly dangerous. All residents are urged to keep windows and doors securely locked at night.
