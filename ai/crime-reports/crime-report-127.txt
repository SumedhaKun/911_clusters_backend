Location: An alleyway behind Rocco's Bar & Grill on 182 Mulberry Street

INCIDENT SUMMARY:
On the evening of November 5th, 2023, the victim, John Roberts (35), was ambushed and violently assaulted while walking alone through a dimly lit alleyway in downtown. Roberts had just left Rocco's Bar after having a few drinks with colleagues after work. 

As Roberts made his way through the alley as a shortcut to his apartment building, an unknown male suspect emerged from the shadows and brutally attacked him without provocation. The suspect did not use any tools or weapons other than his bare hands.

According to Roberts' statement, the suspect first struck him from behind, knocking him to the ground. Roberts was then subjected to a vicious physical beating, receiving multiple blows to the face and body from the suspect's fists. The suspect displayed an excessive and seemingly unprovoked level of violence and force during the assault.

The attack only ended when a nearby resident heard the commotion and shouted that they were calling the police, causing the suspect to immediately flee the scene on foot. Roberts was left bloody and dazed, suffering from a broken nose, multiple lacerations, and suspected cracked ribs.
