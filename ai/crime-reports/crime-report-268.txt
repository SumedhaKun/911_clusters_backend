POLICE REPORT
Case #: 2023-04162
Date: April 16, 2023

Nature of Incident: Bribery of a Public Official

On April 15th, 2023, a concerned citizen contacted the Public Integrity Unit regarding potential bribery activities involving City Councilman Robert Weston. The tipster, who wishes to remain anonymous, alleged that Councilman Weston had been accepting bribes in exchange for influencing city contracts and zoning decisions.

An undercover investigation was immediately launched. Detectives were able to obtain evidence that Weston had been soliciting and accepting cash payments, luxury gifts, and other valuable items from local developers and business owners. It appears Weston used his position on the City Council to steer lucrative contracts and zoning variances in favor of those providing the bribes.

On the morning of April 16th, detectives executed a search warrant at Councilman Weston's residence. During the search, they discovered a hidden safe containing over $85,000 in cash, an exquisite Rolex watch valued at $28,500, and documents detailing apparent bribe payments and illicit arrangements. No weapons or evidence of force were found on the premises.  

Councilman Weston was taken into custody without incident and is currently being held on charges of bribery, mail fraud, and tax evasion. Bail has been set at $1 million.

The investigation is still ongoing as detectives work to identify all parties involved in the bribery scheme and determine the full extent of Weston's illegal activities. Additional charges are likely to be filed.

This case underscores the persistent threat of public corruption and our department's dedication to maintaining the integrity of city government. Anyone with further information related to this case is urged to contact the Public Integrity Hotline.
