INCIDENT REPORT
Case #2023-04182

Date: April 18, 2023
Time: Approximately 2:15 AM 
Location: 125 Oak Street, Parking Garage Level B2

SUMMARY OF INCIDENT:
On the morning of April 18th, a motor vehicle theft occurred in the underground parking garage of the Oak Towers apartment complex. The victim, Samantha Roberts (27), reported that her 2019 Honda Civic was stolen sometime after midnight.

According to Ms. Roberts, she had parked her vehicle in space #B237 at approximately 11:45 PM after returning home from work. When she went to retrieve her car the following morning around 7:30 AM to commute to her job, the vehicle was no longer present. 

EVIDENCE AND FINDINGS:
Upon investigating the parking space, officers discovered signs of forced entry. Pry mark impressions were visible on the driver's side door frame, indicating that a slim jim or similar tool was likely used to open the locked door and gain unauthorized access to the vehicle's interior.

Shards of plastic trim were also found scattered around the space, suggesting that the steering column cover was removed and the wiring was exposed, consistent with a "hotwiring" method to bypass the ignition system and start the engine.

No broken glass or additional property damage was observed at the scene beyond the vehicle entry point. Video surveillance footage from the garage's security cameras is being reviewed, but no suspects have been identified at this time.

No weapons appear to have been involved, though some degree of physical force would have been required to open the door and hotwire the vehicle's electrical systems.

The stolen vehicle is described as a gray 2019 Honda Civic 4-door sedan with California license plate 8MN7V22. An official alert has been issued, and the vehicle's information has been entered into the national database for stolen automobiles.

ACTIONS TAKEN:
- Crime scene processed for evidence
- Video surveillance footage requested 
- Official theft report filed
- Vehicle information entered into stolen vehicle database

This case has been assigned to Detective Mark Holden of the Auto Theft division. The investigation remains active and ongoing at this time. Any witnesses or individuals with relevant information are urged to contact the police department immediately.
