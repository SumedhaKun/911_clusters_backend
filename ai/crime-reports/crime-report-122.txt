Crime: Armed Robbery 

Date/Time: April 15, 2023 / 2:37 AM

Location: 125 Main Street, Oakwood City 

Victim: John Williams (age 56)

On the morning of April 15th at approximately 2:37 AM, a crew of three armed robbers forcibly gained entry into the Main Street Jewelry Store in downtown Oakwood City. The perpetrators used hand tools such as crowbars and hammers to pry open the back entrance door of the store. 

Once inside, the robbers located the store owner, John Williams, who was working late to prepare new jewelry displays. The suspects physically assaulted Mr. Williams, striking him several times and holding him at gunpoint. Witness statements indicate at least two of the robbers were brandishing semi-automatic handguns.

Through intimidation and force, the robbers compelled Mr. Williams to open the main vault and safety deposit boxes. They proceeded to loot the store, smashing glass cases with their tools and stealing an estimated $375,000 worth of jewelry, cash, and other valuables. 

After clearing out the store's inventory, the three suspects bound Mr. Williams with zip ties and fled the scene in a dark colored sedan, possibly a Ford or Chevrolet model. Mr. Williams suffered lacerations and bruising but is expected to make a full recovery.

Evidence collected at the crime scene includes:
- Pry marks on rear entrance door
- Shattered glass from jewelry cases
- Zipties used to restrain victim
- Potential DNA evidence from areas of blood spatter

The investigation is still active and ongoing. Any individuals with knowledge of this crime or possible suspects are urged to contact the Oakwood City Police Department immediately.
