POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case #: 2023-04781
Crime: Cybercrime

On April 12th, 2023, the Cyber Crimes Division received a report from TechCorp Inc. regarding a major data breach and unauthorized intrusion into their secure computer systems. 

The Incident:
According to TechCorp's IT security team, the breach occurred between the hours of 2am and 4am on April 11th. The perpetrators appeared to have gained unauthorized access to TechCorp's network through a sophisticated phishing email campaign. Multiple employees reported opening emails that installed malware on their work stations, creating backdoors for the cyber criminals.

Once inside the network, the criminals used specialized malware tools to elevate their access privileges and move laterally to access TechCorp's most sensitive data repositories. The malware allowed the perpetrators to deploy a type of digital force capable of cracking encrypted files and overcoming security protocols. No physical weapons or use of kinetic force were involved in this crime.

Over 5 terabytes of proprietary research data, customer records, and internal communications were illicitly copied from TechCorp's servers before the breach was detected and shut down. The criminals utilized methods to cover their tracks, but forensics teams were able to retrieve critical digital evidence.

The data theft caused severe financial damages to TechCorp estimated at over $85 million in losses related to corporate espionage, legal fees, and IT remediation costs. Additionally, the breach put thousands of consumer records at risk of exposure.

Evidence:
- Phishing emails with malware payloads traced back to servers in Eastern Europe
- Logs of malware communication with command and control servers
- Timestamped file transfer activities during the breach window
- Recovered segments of encryption cracking tools

The investigation remains active as law enforcement analysts work to identify the perpetrators based on gathered digital evidence. Any individuals with additional information about this cybercrime incident are urged to contact the Cyber Crimes Division at ***-***-*****
