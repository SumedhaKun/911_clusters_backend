Time of Incident: Approximately 2:30 AM 
Location: Border Crossing near Laredo, Texas

Incident Summary:
On the night of April 12th, border patrol agents apprehended a group suspected of drug trafficking after an unauthorized crossing from Mexico into the United States. The suspects did not use any particular tools to breach the border nor did they employ any weapons or force. 

Around 2:30 AM, border patrol cameras detected multiple individuals crossing the Rio Grande river on small rafts from the Mexican side. A team was dispatched to intercept the suspects upon reaching the U.S. bank.

In total, six individuals were taken into custody without incident. A search of their belongings and rafts uncovered 125 pounds of marijuana and 32 kilograms of cocaine bundled in airtight packaging. The illicit drugs have an estimated street value of over $1.5 million dollars.

The six suspects were identified as Mexican nationals with ties to the Sinaloa Cartel, one of the largest drug trafficking organizations operating out of northwest Mexico. They are believed to be low-level mules transporting narcotics across the border for distribution in the U.S.

Evidence and Charges:
- 125 lbs of marijuana 
- 32 kgs of cocaine
- Evidence of unauthorized border crossing

All six suspects were charged with possession of controlled substances with intent to distribute and illegal immigration violations. Additional charges of drug trafficking and conspiracy may be filed pending further investigation.

The narcotics and suspects were transferred to DEA custody for processing and prosecution. Homeland Security Investigations has been notified and will be leading the effort to identify larger distribution networks involved.
