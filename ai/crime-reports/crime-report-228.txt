INCIDENT REPORT
Case #20XX-0418532

Date: April 18, 20XX
Time: Approximately 2:30 AM 
Location: 215 Oak Street, Apartment 3B, Oakwood City

Reported Crime: Assault 

Details of the Incident:
On April 18th at around 2:30 AM, police received a frantic 911 call from a neighbor reporting screams coming from apartment 3B at 215 Oak Street. Officers arrived on the scene at approximately 2:41 AM.

Upon entering the apartment through a broken window, police found the victim, Jane Doe (28), lying unconscious on the floor of the living room. She had visible bruising around her neck consistent with strangulation. A bloody kitchen knife was found next to her body.

Further investigation revealed signs of forced entry through the living room window, with damage to the window frame and glass consistent with a crowbar being used to pry it open. A partial fingerprint was lifted from the crowbar, which was found discarded in some bushes outside.

The victim was transported to Oakwood General Hospital where she was treated for her injuries and strangulation. She regained consciousness but has no memory of the attack or her assailant's identity at this time.

Forensic teams were called to the scene to collect evidence, including the crowbar, knife, fingerprints, hair and fiber samples. Footage from nearby security cameras is also being reviewed to try to identify any suspects.

The incident is being investigated as an assault case with forced entry and strangulation involved. Police are appealing for any witnesses or anyone with information about suspicious persons or activity in the area to come forward.

Case Status: Open/Active Investigation
