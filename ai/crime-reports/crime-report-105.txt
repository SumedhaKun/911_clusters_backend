POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case #2023-04181

Nature of Incident: Cybercrime/Computer Fraud  
Date/Time Reported: April 18, 2023 / 11:32 AM
Location: Global (Internet-based crime)

Summary of Incident:
On the morning of April 18th, the Cyber Crimes Division received multiple reports from individuals and businesses of suspicious activity on their computer systems and financial accounts. Through initial investigation, it appears to be a widespread, coordinated cyber attack carried out by an unknown entity.

The cyber criminals gained access to the victims' devices and networks by deploying sophisticated malware and viruses. This malicious code allowed them to infiltrate secure systems, bypass security protocols, and gain unauthorized access to sensitive data and financial information.

The specific malware used appears to be a new, previously unknown variant that is highly evasive and difficult to detect by traditional antivirus software. Forensic analysis is ongoing to identify the exact nature and capabilities of this malicious program.

No physical force or weapons were used in the commission of these crimes, as they were carried out entirely through virtual/cyber means from remote unknown locations.

Once inside the victims' systems, the perpetrators used specialized hacking tools and techniques to:

- Gain administrative control over devices and networks
- Steal login credentials, financial data, and personal information
- Conduct fraudulent financial transactions and unauthorized fund transfers
- Deploy ransomware to encrypt data and demand cryptocurrency payments

The full scope and impact are still being determined, but initial estimates indicate that hundreds of individuals and dozens of companies across multiple sectors were successfully targeted in this widespread attack.

No individuals or groups have claimed responsibility yet. Cyber forensic experts and federal agencies are working to trace the origins of the attack and identify the perpetrators.

The investigation remains open and active. All available resources are being dedicated to mitigating the attack, securing vulnerable systems, and pursuing those responsible for these cyber crimes.
