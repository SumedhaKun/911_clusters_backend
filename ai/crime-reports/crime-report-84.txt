POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case #: 2023-04837
Date: April 15, 2023
Nature of Incident: Environmental Crime - Illegal Dumping of Hazardous Waste

On the evening of April 14th, 2023, the Riverton Police Department received an anonymous tip about suspicious activity occurring behind the abandoned Brickyard Factory on the outskirts of town. Officer Davis was dispatched to investigate the report.  

Upon arrival at approximately 10:15 PM, Officer Davis detected a strong chemical odor emanating from behind the factory premises. He followed the smell to a secluded area where he discovered several large industrial drums that appeared to have been recently dumped. The drums were leaking an unknown viscous liquid substance onto the ground.

Officer Davis immediately established a safety perimeter and requested backup and a hazmat team to the scene. Further investigation revealed that the soil in the area had been heavily saturated by the leaked materials over an approximately 20 x 30 ft area.

Samples of the liquid and soil were carefully obtained by the hazmat team and sent to a lab for analysis. Preliminary tests indicated the presence of highly toxic chemicals including chromium, lead, and benzene - materials commonly found in industrial degreasers and paint strippers.

An extensive search of the area uncovered no witnesses or evidence that could identify the perpetrators. However, tire tracks were found suggesting that a large truck or trailer had been used to transport the drums to the dumping location.

Further investigation is still ongoing, but this case appears to be an environmental crime involving the illegal dumping and disposal of hazardous industrial waste materials. Such reckless actions pose a severe risk to the local environment and community health.

The Riverton Police Department is seeking any information that could help identify those responsible for this environmental contamination incident. A reward of $10,000 is being offered for any tip leading to the arrest and conviction of the perpetrators.
