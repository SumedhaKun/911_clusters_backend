POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case #: 2023-04159

Crime: Witness Tampering 

Date/Time: April 17, 2023 / 8:15 PM

Location: 215 Oak Street, Apartment 3B, Oakwood City

Victim: 
Jessica Wilkins (28)

Suspect:
Robert Gamino (42)  

Details:
On the evening of April 17th, the victim, Ms. Jessica Wilkins, was at her apartment when the suspect, Mr. Robert Gamino, came to her door. Wilkins was a key witness in an upcoming trial against Gamino for drug trafficking charges.  

Gamino forced his way into Wilkins' apartment and confronted her aggressively about her intention to testify against him. The suspect did not use any physical weapons, but he towered over the petite victim in an intimidating manner and yelled threats about harming her if she took the witness stand. 

Gamino stated repeatedly, "If you get up on that stand and testify, you'll regret it for the rest of your life, you rat!" He punched the wall near Wilkins' head, leaving a hole as a display of his rage and capability for violence.

The suspect knew the victim's address and details about the upcoming court proceedings from unknown sources, suggesting he may have paid someone to obtain this confidential information illegally.

After nearly an hour of harrowing verbal threats and intimidation tactics, Gamino finally left Wilkins' apartment. She immediately called 911 reporting the incident. Officers arrested Gamino at his residence a short time later.

Evidence:
- Statements from the victim
- Hole in wall from suspect's punched drywall
- Suspect's clothing/possessions for DNA
- Building security camera footage 

Current Status: 
Robert Gamino has been charged with witness tampering and is being held without bail pending trial. The prosecution is seeking additional charges related to the original drug case based on the new intimidation incident.
