POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case #2023-04187

Crime: Armed Robbery 

Date/Time: April 12, 2023 / 10:45 PM

Location: 215 Oak Street, Riverton 

Summary of Incident:
On the evening of April 12th, the Riverton Police Department received a 911 call from a residence on Oak Street regarding an armed robbery in progress. Officers were dispatched to the scene immediately. 

Upon arrival, officers encountered the victim, John Roberts (34), who had visible injuries to his face. Mr. Roberts stated that he returned home from work around 10:30 PM and was entering through the back door of his residence when he was ambushed by an unknown male suspect. 

The suspect had allegedly picked the lock of the back door earlier, using a professional lockpicking kit, and was lying in wait inside the victim's home. As Mr. Roberts opened the door, the suspect rushed him from behind and punched him in the face, causing a laceration above his right eye and a suspected broken nose.

After assaulting the victim, the suspect brandished a handgun and demanded Mr. Roberts' wallet and valuables. Fearing for his life, the victim complied and handed over his wallet containing $230 in cash, his iPhone 13, and a Rolex wristwatch valued at approximately $7,500. 

The suspect then fled the scene on foot. A canvass of the neighborhood was conducted but the suspect remains at large. He is described as a white male, approximately 6' tall, 180 lbs, wearing a black hoodie, blue jeans, and a ski mask.

Evidence collected at the scene includes:
- Lockpicking kit found near back door
- Pry marks on door frame 
- Victim's blood stains in kitchen
- Surveillance footage from neighbor's home (unknown if suspect was captured)

The victim was treated by paramedics for his injuries and transported to Riverton Memorial Hospital. 

This case has been assigned to Detective Mark Billingham. All leads will be investigated. Anyone with information about this incident is urged to contact the Riverton Police Department immediately.
