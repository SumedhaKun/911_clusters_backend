POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case #: 2023-04281

Nature of Incident: Cyber Attack/Data Breach

Date/Time of Incident: April 12, 2023 / Between 2:00 AM - 4:00 AM 

Location of Incident: Global Finance Corporation (Corporate Headquarters)

INCIDENT DETAILS:

On the morning of April 12th, the IT security team at Global Finance Corporation detected suspicious network activity and potential unauthorized access to their secure databases. Upon further investigation, it was discovered that the company had fallen victim to a sophisticated cyber attack.

The perpetrators gained access by exploiting a previously unknown vulnerability in one of the company's web application servers. Malware was injected into the system, allowing the hackers to move laterally and breach deeper into the network infrastructure. Phishing emails were also deployed as part of the attack, tricking employees into inadvertently providing login credentials.

Once inside, the cyber criminals deployed malicious programs and scripts to exfiltrate large amounts of highly sensitive financial data, including customer records, transaction histories, and proprietary algorithmic trading models. Evidence suggests the data was siphoned out in encrypted payloads to a server located in a nation known for harboring cyber criminal groups.

No physical weapons or force were utilized in the attack, as it was conducted remotely via the internet. However, the company's cybersecurity defenses were overwhelmed by the persistent onslaught of malware and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks used to distract and disable security monitoring systems.

The full scope of data compromised and financial damages are still being assessed by the company's incident response team and third-party forensics experts. Global Finance Corporation is working closely with the FBI Cyber Crimes Unit and international law enforcement agencies to identify and apprehend those responsible.

Case Status: Open/Active Investigation
