Police Report #2022-07183

Crime Type: Burglary

On the night of August 12th, 2022, a breaking and entering occurred at the residence of John and Jane Smith located at 456 Oak Tree Lane. According to the victims, they returned home around 10:30pm after being out for dinner to find their front door had been forced open.

Upon entering, it was clear an intruder had been inside as multiple rooms were ransacked with belongings strewn about. The perpetrator appeared to have gained access by breaking and entering through the front door. 

The front door frame showed clear signs of forced entry, with wood splintered and the deadbolt lock completely broken off. Based on the damage, it seems common burglary tools like a pry bar or crowbar were likely used to forcibly pry open the door.

Once inside, the intruder made their way upstairs to the master bedroom where the victims' personal safe was located. The safe itself showed no signs of forced entry, indicating the combination or key was already known to the perpetrator. Approximately $25,000 in cash and jewelry was reported stolen from inside the safe.

In addition, a laptop computer and Mrs. Smith's purse containing personal ID and credit cards were also taken during the crime. Aside from the damaged front door frame, there were no other signs of vandalism or force used against the residents themselves.

The police investigation is still ongoing, but the incident has raised concerns about the perpetrator potentially being someone close to the victims who knew the safe combination and lay out of the home. Neighbors are being interviewed and local pawn shops/fencers alerted about any attempts to sell the stolen goods.

Forensic teams have collected tool marks and fingerprint evidence from the scene which is being processed. The public is urged to contact the police immediately if they have any information that could aid in identifying the burglar and recovering the stolen property.
