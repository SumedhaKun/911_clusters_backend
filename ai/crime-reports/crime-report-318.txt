POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case #2023-04182

Crime: Kidnapping 

Date/Time: April 18, 2023 - 10:32 PM

Location: 128 Maple St, Oakwood Heights

Victim: 
John Bauer, 32 years old

Suspect(s):
Unknown, investigation ongoing

Details:
On the evening of April 18th, a kidnapping occurred at the residence of John Bauer. According to statements from Mr. Bauer's wife, Mary, she heard a commotion around 10:30 PM coming from the backyard of their home. Upon investigating, she witnessed two masked individuals forcing her husband into a black unmarked van at gunpoint. 

The suspects are believed to have gained entry to the backyard by cutting through a section of the perimeter fence using bolt cutters. Once inside, they ambushed Mr. Bauer as he was taking out the trash. Eyewitness accounts from neighbors report hearing yells and the sound of a scuffle.

Evidence at the scene includes torn clothing, presumed to be Mr. Bauer's, as well as a single 9mm bullet casing. It appears at least one gunshot was fired, likely as a scare tactic or warning shot. The van used in the kidnapping has not yet been located.

The two suspects were both described as wearing dark clothing, ski masks, and gloves. One was reportedly carrying a crowbar, while the other had a semi-automatic handgun. Their identities and motives remain unknown at this time.

Mr. Bauer is a financial analyst at Cerron Investment Firm downtown. Investigators are looking into any potential corporate conflicts or disgruntled clients that may have led to this kidnapping. Ransom demands have not yet been received.

Anyone with any information regarding this case is urged to contact the Oakwood Heights Police Department immediately.
