POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case #: 2023-04617

Crime Type: Armed Robbery

On April 17th, 2023 at approximately 10:30 PM, officers responded to a panic alarm from the First National Bank at 125 Main Street. Upon arrival, officers found signs of forced entry through the rear loading dock door. Surveillance footage shows three masked suspects dressed in black tactical gear breaching the bank's security using a thermal lance to cut through the steel door. 

Once inside, the suspects immediately drew their weapons - two semi-automatic handguns and one pump-action shotgun. They located and gathered the six bank employees who were still on premises conducting after-hours work. The suspects bound the employees' hands with zip ties and moved them into the vault area at gunpoint.

Using specialized safecracking tools including a burning bar and an oxy-acetylene torch, the suspects were able to breach the large circular vault door in under ten minutes. They proceeded to empty dozens of safe deposit boxes and teller cash drawers into large duffel bags.

At approximately 10:45 PM, the suspects exited through the rear loading dock, firing several warning shots from their weapons to deter any civilians from intervening. No civilians were harmed. The suspects escaped in a waiting getaway vehicle, a black Ford Expedition. The total amount of money, jewelry, and valuables stolen is still being assessed but is estimated to be over $3 million.

The suspects are still at large and considered armed and extremely dangerous. They are described as:
- 3 males 
- Approx 6 ft tall, athletic builds
- Dressed in black tactical clothing and masks

Evidence collected at the scene includes shell casings, DNA from discarded food/drink, and footprints. Detectives are reviewing surveillance footage and following up on leads. Anyone with information is urged to contact the police department immediately.

This was a brazen and meticulously planned heist by an experienced and sophisticated criminal team. The use of violent force, powerful weapons, and specialized tools to breach multiple layers of security are extremely concerning. The safety of civilians and law enforcement is the top priority as the manhunt continues for these armed and dangerous suspects.
