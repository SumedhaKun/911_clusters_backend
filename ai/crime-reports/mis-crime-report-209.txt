POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case #: 2023-04617

Crime Type: Armed Robbery 

On the night of April 22nd, 2023, a daring and ruthless crew of thieves executed a meticulously planned heist at the First National Bank in downtown Oakwood. The suspects gained access to the bank by cutting through the roof using high-powered cutting tools, likely diamond-tipped drill bits and oxy-acetylene torches - common tools used to breach secure locations.

Once inside, the criminals proceeded with extreme force, physically assaulting and restraining three night security guards who were making their rounds. Eyewitness accounts describe the suspects as wearing tactical gear and face coverings, brandishing firearms to subdue their victims. 

The assailants then made their way to the vault, using high-grade plastic explosives to blow open the vault door. Inside, they cleaned out dozens of safety deposit boxes, taking an estimated $5.2 million in cash, jewelry, and other valuables.

Weapons Used: Handguns (likely 9mm semi-automatic pistols based on shell casings recovered)

As the crew attempted their escape, a gunfight broke out with responding police officers, with both sides exchanging gunfire. Two officers sustained non-life-threatening gunshot wounds before the suspects fled the scene in a stolen armored truck.

Evidence recovered includes spent ammunition, tools used in the break-in, and trace evidence like shoe prints and fabric fibers. Authorities are reviewing security footage and following up on leads, but the suspects remain at large.

This brazen act showed an extreme level of force, sophisticated planning, and complete disregard for human life. Police are committed to bringing these violent criminals to justice using all available resources and are asking anyone with information to come forward.
