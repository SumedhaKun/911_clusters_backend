Summary of Incident:
On April 17th at approximately 2:30 AM, a crew of four masked suspects forced entry into the Main Street Bank through the rear entrance. Utilizing a crowbar and a small sledgehammer, the suspects were able to pry open the back door after disabling the alarm system. 

Once inside, the suspects immediately confronted the overnight security guard at gunpoint. Brandishing semi-automatic pistols, the suspects violently assaulted the guard, binding him with zip ties. They then made their way to the vault room.

Employing an oxy-acetylene torch, the suspects were able to cut through the vault door's locking mechanism after nearly an hour of effort. Inside the vault, the suspects cleared out all available cash reserves, stuffing duffel bags full of bills. 

In total, the suspects escaped with an estimated $3.2 million in cash before fleeing out the rear entrance. The entire robbery took approximately 2 hours and 45 minutes to complete. The security guard sustained minor injuries but was treated at the scene.

Evidence Recovered:
- Pry marks on rear entrance door
- Shoeprints near vault room (size 11)
- Burned sections of vault door from torch
- Zip ties used to restrain guard
- Sledgehammer head imprint on vault room wall

No other evidence was found at the scene. Suspects remain at large and are considered armed and extremely dangerous. Anyone with information is asked to contact the police immediately.
