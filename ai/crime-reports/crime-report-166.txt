Police Report #2023-457891

Crime Type: Stalking 

On March 15th, 2023, the victim, Jane Doe (32), reported being stalked by an unknown individual over the past several weeks. Ms. Doe stated that she first noticed the suspect following her home from work on February 28th. She recalled seeing a male, approximately 5'10" with a slim build, wearing a dark hooded sweatshirt and jeans, lingering near the entrance of her office building when she left for the evening. 

Over the next two weeks, Ms. Doe reported multiple incidents of the same individual following her, including to the gym, the grocery store, and while running errands around town. The suspect made no attempt to approach or contact her directly. However, his persistent presence and clear focus on trailing her every move left Ms. Doe feeling extremely unnerved and unsafe.

On March 14th, the stalking behavior escalated when Ms. Doe arrived home from work to find the suspect loitering on her apartment building's front steps. Frightened, she did not exit her vehicle and instead drove to a friend's house and contacted the police from there.  

Increased patrols were conducted in the area of the victim's residence and workplace over the following days, but the suspect was not located. Ms. Doe was advised to vary her routine and travel in groups when possible as the investigation continues.

No threats, weapons, or forced entry were involved in this case of criminal stalking and harassment. However, the victim states she now lives in constant fear due to the suspect's unrelenting and unsolicited following and monitoring of her daily activities.
