POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case #2023-04851

Nature of Incident: Prostitution

On April 15th, 2023 at approximately 11:30 PM, officers responded to a call regarding suspected prostitution activity at the Bel-Air Motel on 125th Street. Upon arrival, officers made contact with the motel clerk who stated that they had witnessed multiple individuals entering and leaving a room rented under the name "Candy Stevens" in short time increments, behavior consistent with prostitution.

Officers established surveillance and witnessed over the course of 2 hours at least 6 different males entering the room one at a time and staying for periods ranging from 15 minutes to 1 hour before leaving. Utilizing night vision equipment, officers were able to identify currency being exchanged between the males and the occupant of the room prior to entry.

At approximately 1:45 AM, officers knocked on the door which was answered by a Caucasian female, later identified as Tiffany Jones (28). Ms. Jones was found to be scantily clad. After establishing probable cause, officers entered the room and took Ms. Jones into custody without incident.

Evidence collected at the scene included $327 in cash bundled together, assorted condoms and lubricants, a notebook appearing to contain a client ledger, and trace evidence indicating the presence of bodily fluids.

Ms. Jones was transported to central booking and charged with prostitution and operating a house of prostitution. No weapons or other means of force were used or found on the premises.

The investigation is ongoing as officers attempt to identify the males involved as potential pimps or human traffickers. Anyone with further information is urged to contact...
