Location: 825 Maple Lane, Somerville

Victim: 
John Williams, 48 years old

Suspect:
Unknown at this time

Details:
On the evening of April 12th, the victim, Mr. John Williams, reported being the target of an extortion attempt. Mr. Williams, a local business owner, received a series of threatening phone calls at his place of business demanding he pay $50,000 or face unspecified consequences. 

The suspect(s) did not gain access to the business premises, nor did they use any physical force or weapons during the extortion attempt. However, the phone calls contained explicit threats of violence and property damage if the demands were not met.

According to Mr. Williams, the caller had a deep, disguised voice and did not reveal any identifying information. The calls appeared to come from a blocked number. The suspect(s) did not specify a method for delivering the extortion payment.

Mr. Williams stated that he has no known enemies or conflicts that could explain the extortion attempt. He has owned and operated his small manufacturing firm for over 15 years without any previous incidents.

The case has been assigned to Detective Caroline Reeves of the Organized Crime Unit for further investigation. Efforts are underway to obtain phone records and other evidence that may help identify the suspect(s). Increased police patrols have been implemented in the area surrounding the victim's business and residence as a precautionary measure.

The Somerville Police Department takes extortion threats extremely seriously. Anyone with information related to this case is urged to contact the department immediately.
