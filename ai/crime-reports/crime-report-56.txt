Details of Incident:
On the evening of April 17th, the victim, John Davies, was at Murphy's Pub having drinks with friends. At approximately 11:45 PM, the suspect, Mark Jennings, approached Davies in an unprovoked manner. Words were allegedly exchanged before the suspect suddenly punched Davies in the face, causing him to fall to the ground. 

While Davies was on the floor, the suspect continued his assault, kicking him repeatedly in the torso and head area. Witnesses state that the suspect was wearing knuckle dusters during the attack, likely causing more severe injuries.

Bar staff intervened and were able to subdue and detain Jennings until police arrived on the scene. Davies sustained a broken nose, fractured cheekbone, and cerebral contusions from the blows to the head. He was transported to Memorial Hospital for treatment.

Jennings was arrested and has been charged with aggravated assault and assault with a deadly weapon. Alcohol is believed to be a factor. He is being held on $50,000 bond pending his arraignment.

The incident was captured by security cameras inside the bar. Footage has been obtained as evidence. A statement from Davies is still pending due to his injuries.
