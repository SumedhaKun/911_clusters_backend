POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case No: 2023-04785

Crime: Embezzlement 

Date/Time: April 12, 2023 / Unknown 

Location: XYZ Corporation, 123 Main Street

Victim: XYZ Corporation 

Summary of Incident:
This embezzlement case involves a longtime employee of XYZ Corporation, John Doe (name changed), who is suspected of systematically diverting company funds into his personal accounts over a period of several years. 

Doe had worked in the accounting department at XYZ for over 15 years, giving him intimate knowledge of the company's financial systems and protocols. It appears he abused his authorized access privileges to siphon off funds in increasing amounts without raising any immediate red flags.

The scheme came to light during a routine audit when major discrepancies were found between financial records and actual cash flows. Upon deeper investigation, a pattern of fraudulent transactions was uncovered, all traced back to Doe's user accounts and computer workstation.

Forensic analysis of Doe's work computer and email revealed sophisticated techniques were used to cover his tracks, including:
- Altering general ledger entries
- Creating bogus vendor accounts and fake invoices 
- Routing payments to his own accounts disguised as legitimate expenses

It is currently estimated that Doe embezzled over $3.2 million from XYZ Corporation over the past 5 years alone. No direct force or weapons were used in the commission of this crime, as Doe simply exploited his position and computer access.

John Doe was arrested at his residence on April 13th. He is currently being held without bail on charges of embezzlement, fraud, money laundering and several other financial crimes. The investigation is still ongoing to determine the full extent of the losses and whether any other individuals may have been involved.

Investigating Officers:
