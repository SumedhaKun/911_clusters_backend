The Wilson family reported that several items of value were stolen, including:

- A 55" flat-screen television 
- An iPad Pro
- A woman's diamond tennis bracelet
- Approximately $300 in cash

The total estimated value of the stolen goods is $3,500.

Forensic teams were dispatched to the scene to collect potential evidence, including fingerprints and any DNA traces left behind by the perpetrator(s). Neighbors in the vicinity have been interviewed, but no one reported seeing or hearing anything suspicious during the time of the incident.

The investigation into this case is ongoing, and the Oakwood Police Department urges anyone with information regarding this break-in or the whereabouts of the stolen items to contact the tip line at 555-CRIME.
