Date: May 3, 2023

INCIDENT DETAILS:
On the night of May 2, 2023, at approximately 11:45 PM, a robbery occurred at the First National Bank located at 125 Main Street. The suspect, who remains at large, gained entry to the bank by picking the lock on the rear entrance using a professional lock pick set. 

Once inside, the suspect proceeded to the vault room. Security footage shows the suspect was able to bypass the vault's locking mechanism, likely using their lock picking tools. The suspect then loaded an undisclosed amount of cash, bonds, and other valuables into a duffel bag.

As the suspect was exiting through the rear entrance, they encountered a night security guard on patrol. The suspect threatened the guard at gunpoint with a black semi-automatic handgun, forcing the guard to lie on the floor. The suspect then fled the scene on foot.

WITNESS DESCRIPTION:
The security guard described the suspect as a male, approximately 5'10" to 6' tall with an athletic build. He was wearing a black ski mask, dark clothing, and gloves.

EVIDENCE RECOVERED:
- Footprints from the rear entrance potentially belonging to the suspect
- Pry marks on the vault's locking mechanism
- Strands of fiber, potentially from the suspect's clothing
- Fingerprints recovered from various surfaces (being analyzed)

The investigation is ongoing. Any person with information about this incident is urged to contact the police department immediately.
