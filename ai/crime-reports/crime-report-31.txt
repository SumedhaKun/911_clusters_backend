SUSPECT:
Unknown male, approximately 5'10", medium build, wearing dark clothing and a ski mask.

DETAILS:
On the evening of April 12th, the victim was walking home alone after getting off work at a restaurant downtown. As he reached the 700 block of Main Street, a male suspect approached him from behind holding a handgun. The suspect confronted the victim, stuck the gun in his back, and demanded his wallet and cell phone. 

The victim complied out of fear, handing over his leather bi-fold wallet containing $85 cash, credit cards, and ID, as well as his iPhone 13. After obtaining the victim's belongings, the suspect stated "Don't try anything stupid or I'll blow your head off." He then fled on foot heading east on Main Street. 

The victim called 911 immediately after the incident occurred to report the armed robbery. Officers canvassed the area but were unable to locate the suspect. The investigation is ongoing as detectives review any available surveillance footage and follow up on leads.

This was an armed robbery committed through use of force by threatening the victim at gunpoint while he was out walking on a public street. No tools were used to access the location, as the crime occurred outside in the open. The suspect made off with the victim's wallet, cash, phone, and credit cards after confronting him with a handgun.
