Case #: 2023-04617
Date/Time: April 12, 2023 / 2:37 AM

Crime Type: Burglary 

On the morning of April 12th, officers responded to a call at the First National Bank of Oakwood regarding a break-in and robbery. Upon arrival, it was discovered that the suspects had gained entry to the bank through physical intrusion.

The crime scene investigation revealed that the suspects used common burglary tools such as a lock picking set, a pry bar, and a high-powered cutting torch to breach the bank's security measures. Evidence suggests that the suspects were highly skilled and experienced in bypassing advanced locking mechanisms and alarm systems.

Once inside the bank, the suspects used brute force to access the vault area. The heavy vault door showed signs of being cut through with the high-intensity cutting torch. Scorch marks and melted metal were found on the door and surrounding areas.

Witness statements from the overnight security guard indicated that at least three individuals were involved in the heist. The guard reported being overpowered and restrained by the suspects, who wielded semi-automatic handguns and threatened the use of lethal force if he did not comply.

The suspects made off with an undisclosed amount of cash, jewelry, and other valuables from the bank's safety deposit boxes. Forensic teams are currently analyzing evidence collected from the scene, including fingerprints, DNA traces, and any potential security camera footage.

The investigation is ongoing, and the police are urging anyone with information about the incident or the suspects involved to come forward immediately. A substantial reward is being offered for any information leading to the arrest and conviction of the perpetrators.

This brazen heist has left the community shaken and has prompted calls for increased security measures at financial institutions throughout the city.
