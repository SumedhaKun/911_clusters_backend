POLICE INCIDENT REPORT

Case Number: 2023-04617
Date: April 12, 2023
Incident: Breaking and Entering, Robbery

On April 12th, 2023 at approximately 2:15 AM, officers responded to a call regarding a break-in at the First National Bank on Main Street. Upon arrival, officers discovered that the front entrance had been forcibly breached using common tools used to access secure locations.

According to the bank's security footage, two suspects dressed in dark clothing and wearing balaclavas gained entry by using a crowbar to pry open the front doors. The suspects then proceeded to the vault area where they employed lock picking tools to bypass the vault's locking mechanisms.

Once inside the vault, the suspects collected an undisclosed amount of cash, precious gems, and other valuables into duffel bags they had brought with them. The type of force used by the suspects was non-violent, as no weapons were used during the crime.

The suspects exhibited a high level of skill and preparation, disabling the security cameras and alarm systems with advanced hacking tools. They appeared to have an intimate knowledge of the bank's layout and security protocols.

After approximately 45 minutes inside the bank, the suspects exited through the same entrance they had breached earlier. They then fled the scene in a dark-colored van that was waiting outside.

No bank employees or bystanders were harmed during the incident, as the suspects did not use any weapons or physical force against individuals.

The investigation is ongoing, and authorities are reviewing all available evidence, including security footage and forensic analysis of the crime scene. Anyone with information regarding this incident is urged to contact the police department immediately.
