POLICE REPORT
Case #: 2023-04785

Crime Type: Extortion

On the evening of April 12th, 2023, the victim, John Randall, reported being the target of an extortion attempt. Mr. Randall, a successful businessman in the city, received a series of threatening phone calls demanding a large sum of money in exchange for the safety of his family.

According to Mr. Randall's statement, the perpetrator did not physically access any secure locations or use any specialized tools. However, the mode of accessing the victim was through intimidation tactics and veiled threats made over the phone.

The type of force used in this crime was psychological, as the perpetrator employed fear and intimidation to coerce the victim into compliance. No physical force or weapons were used in the commission of this crime.

The perpetrator, who remains unidentified at this time, made repeated phone calls to Mr. Randall's home and office numbers, demanding a payment of $500,000 within 72 hours. The caller claimed to have knowledge of Mr. Randall's family members' daily routines and threatened to harm them if the demand was not met.

During the phone calls, the perpetrator's voice was distorted, making it difficult to discern any distinguishing characteristics or identify the caller. The caller also used a restricted phone number, preventing the tracing of the calls.

Mr. Randall reported feeling deeply disturbed and fearful for the safety of his loved ones. He has cooperated fully with the investigation and provided authorities with detailed accounts of the phone calls and any potential leads or clues that may assist in identifying the perpetrator.

The investigation is ongoing, and authorities are exploring all available avenues to locate and apprehend the individual responsible for this extortion attempt. Increased patrols have been assigned to monitor the Randall family's residence and places of business.

Any individuals with information pertaining to this case are urged to contact the police department immediately.
