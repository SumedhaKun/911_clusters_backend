INCIDENT REPORT

Case Number: 2023-04152
Incident Type: Vandalism 
Date/Time Reported: April 15, 2023 - 10:35 PM
Location: Downtown City Park

SUMMARY OF INCIDENT:
On the evening of April 15th, officers responded to multiple reports of vandalism occurring at the Downtown City Park. Upon arrival, they discovered extensive property damage had been inflicted on several areas of the park.

The park's main entrance sign had been defaced with bright red spray paint, with explicit words and crude images covering much of its surface. The public restroom building also showed signs of vandalism, with its outer walls covered in graffiti "tags" and deeply gouged with what appeared to be hammer strikes.

Several park benches were knocked over and broken, and at least one drinking fountain was completely smashed, leaving shards of cement and piping strewn about. A section of decorative wrought iron fencing along the park's walking trail had been forcibly bent and broken in multiple places.

EVIDENCE COLLECTED:
- Multiple spray paint cans of various colors found discarded near vandalized areas
- A claw hammer with paint markings on the head 
- Shoeprints and other potential evidence documented

WITNESSES:
- Jane Doe, a park-goer out for an evening walk, reported seeing a group of 4-5 young males, possibly teenagers, fleeing from the park carrying backpacks around 10:15 PM.
- No other credible witnesses were located at the scene.

ACTIONS TAKEN:
- Park closed off with crime scene tape
- Evidence collected for processing
- Increased patrol scheduled for the area

This act of senseless property destruction has deeply impacted our community's sense of pride in this historic city park. The investigation into identifying the perpetrators remains active and ongoing. Anyone with any additional information is urged to contact the police department immediately.
