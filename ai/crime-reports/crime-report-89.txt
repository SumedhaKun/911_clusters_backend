POLICE REPORT

Case Number: 2023-04281
Incident Type: Homicide
Date of Incident: April 17, 2023
Time of Incident: Approximately 10:30 PM

On the evening of April 17th, officers responded to a 911 call reporting gunshots heard in the vicinity of 125 Maple Lane. Upon arrival, officers discovered the body of a male victim, later identified as John Smith, age 35, lying in a pool of blood in the hallway of his apartment.

The victim appeared to have suffered multiple gunshot wounds to the torso and head area from what is believed to be a semi-automatic handgun. A large kitchen knife was also found near the body, indicating that the perpetrator may have used both a firearm and a blade in carrying out this vicious attack.

Based on evidence collected at the scene, it seems the murderer gained access to Mr. Smith's apartment through forcible means, likely kicking down the front door. No signs of forced entry were found on any windows or other points of entry. Neighbors reported hearing loud bangs consistent with someone forcibly entering followed by shouting and multiple gunshots.

The apartment was processed by crime scene investigators, who collected ballistic evidence, blood splatters, shoe prints, and fingerprints. The perpetrator does not appear to have used any specialized tools to bypass the apartment's lock, instead relying on brute physical force to gain entry.

Detectives are exploring all possible motives, including robbery, a personal dispute, or an act related to Mr. Smith's employment at a local banking firm. No valuables appear to have been taken from the apartment.

The murder weapon has not been recovered at this time. Detectives are canvassing the area and following up on any leads. The victim's vehicle, a 2019 Honda Accord, is also missing from its usual parking spot.

Anyone with information about this homicide or who may have witnessed any suspicious activity in the area during the late evening hours of April 17th is urged to contact the Police Department's tip line immediately.

This violent crime has deeply shaken our community. We are utilizing every available resource to locate the perpetrator and bring them to justice swiftly. Our condolences go out to Mr. Smith's family during this unimaginably difficult time.
