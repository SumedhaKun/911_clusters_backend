Date of Incident: April 17, 2023
Location: Downtown Business District 

INCIDENT SUMMARY:
On the night of April 17th, 2023, a theft occurred at the offices of TechCorp Solutions located at 115 Main Street. The suspect, who remains unidentified, appears to have picked the lock to the main entrance using a lockpicking kit. Once inside, the suspect proceeded to the accounting department where they stole petty cash totaling $5,000 as well as confidential client files. No weapons were brandished and no employees or bystanders were harmed during the incident. 

DETAILS:
At approximately 11:45 PM, a silent alarm was triggered at the TechCorp offices. Police responded to the scene within 10 minutes but the suspect had already fled. Evidence collected indicates that the lock on the front entrance showed signs of being expertly picked, with scratches and markings consistent with the use of a lockpicking kit. 

Security footage shows a figure dressed in dark clothing and a baseball cap entering through the front door at 11:32 PM. The suspect is seen walking directly to the accounting office and spending about 8 minutes inside before exiting at 11:40 PM carrying a briefcase and what looks like a cash box.

The accounting manager, Jane Smith, was immediately notified and came to the scene. She stated that a petty cash box containing approximately $5,000 was missing from the office safe. Additionally, three client file folders were also taken from the locked cabinet. No other areas were disturbed.

At this time, no suspects have been identified and the investigation is ongoing. Police are reviewing all available security footage from the area and canvassing for any witnesses. The lockpicking kit used has been sent to the forensics lab for potential DNA or fingerprint evidence.

This was a professional job displaying advanced lock picking abilities. No forced entry or weapons were used. The suspect was likely hired for this specific crime and has prior experience. We are looking at potential links to other similar corporate thefts in the area.
