POLICE INCIDENT REPORT

Case Number: 2023-047821
Report Date: May 15, 2023

Nature of Incident: Corruption of Public Official 

On May 12, 2023, the City Fraud Investigation Unit received an anonymous tip regarding potential corrupt activities involving City Councilman Richard Greene. The tipster alleged that Councilman Greene had been accepting bribes from local business owners in exchange for preferential treatment on zoning and contract approvals.

Undercover Investigation:
Based on the credible tip, detectives launched an undercover sting operation code-named "Operation Quid Pro Quo." Detectives posed as representatives of Acme Development Corporation, a fake company purportedly interested in a multi-million dollar downtown redevelopment project that required City Council approval. 

On May 14th, detectives met with Councilman Greene at an upscale restaurant. After discussing details of the fictitious project over an expensive lunch paid for by the "company representatives," Greene was recorded stating that securing his vote would require a "contribution" to his re-election campaign fund. He suggested a $50,000 payment be made to an anonymous shell corporation he controlled.

The payoff was arranged, and on May 15th, Greene accepted a briefcase containing $50,000 in cash from the undercover detectives in the restaurant's parking lot. Immediately after the exchange, surveillance teams monitoring the operation moved in and arrested Greene without incident.

Evidence:
-Videotape of face-to-face meetings and payoff
-Audiotape recordings of conversations about the bribe
-$50,000 in cash paid to the councilman
-Bank records for the shell corporation 
-Email correspondence discussing the bribe

Charges:
Richard Greene was charged with Bribery of a Public Official, Corruption, Money Laundering, and Abuse of Public Trust. He was terminated from the City Council and released on $100,000 bond pending trial.

This case represents an egregious breach of the public's trust by an elected official. The City's Fraud Unit will continue to thoroughly investigate and aggressively prosecute any instances of corruption and abuse of power.
