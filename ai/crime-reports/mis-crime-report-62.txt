POLICE INCIDENT REPORT

Crime Type: Home Invasion/Burglary 

Date/Time of Incident: March 17th, 2023 - 2:15 AM

Location: 215 Oak Tree Lane, Brookfield

Victim(s): John and Jane Smith

On March 17th at approximately 2:15 AM, the Brookfield Police Department received a frantic 911 call from Jane Smith reporting a home invasion in progress at her residence. Upon arrival, officers found clear signs of a forced entry through a rear window of the home. 

The victims, John and Jane Smith, were bound and gagged in their upstairs bedroom. They reported being awoken by loud noises coming from the first floor of their home. Three masked intruders wielding crowbars had smashed through a rear window and made their way inside.

The suspects confronted the victims at gunpoint, demanding cash and valuables. Mr. Smith was pistol whipped when he refused to comply, suffering a laceration to the head requiring medical treatment. The suspects then bound the victims with zip ties and ripped phones from the walls to prevent them from calling for help.

After ransacking the home for approximately 45 minutes, the suspects made off with a laptop, jewelry, and $3,000 in cash from a safe they were able to access using tools from the home's garage. Forensic teams are analyzing evidence recovered at the scene including fingerprints, hair/fiber samples, and footprints.

The victims described the suspects as three males in their 20s-30s, wearing dark clothing and ski masks. One was overheard speaking with what sounded like a Russian accent. They were seen fleeing in a dark colored SUV, possibly a Ford Explorer.

This is an active and ongoing investigation. Anyone with information is urged to contact the Brookfield Police Department's tip line. A $10,000 reward is being offered for information leading to the identification and arrest of the suspects.
