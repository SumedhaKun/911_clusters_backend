SUMMARY OF INCIDENT:

On the evening of April 17th, 2023, a brazen armed robbery occurred at the Main Street Bank in downtown Townville. At approximately 10:20 PM, two masked suspects forcefully entered the bank through the rear entrance door just before closing time. 

The suspects, both males dressed in dark clothing and ski masks concealing their faces, immediately brandished handguns and ordered all employees and customers to the ground. One suspect, wielding a black semi-automatic pistol, jumped over the teller counter while his accomplice stood guard.

With the bank staff frozen in fear, the first suspect violently emptied the cash from the teller drawers into a large duffel bag. "Don't anybody move or try anything stupid!" he shouted, waving his gun menacingly. 

After clearing the teller stations of cash, the two suspects exited through the same rear door they entered, fleeing on foot down the alleyway behind the bank. No shots were fired but three employees reported minor injuries from being shoved to the floor during the robbery.

Total cash loss is estimated at $37,500. No dye packs or trackable GPS devices were taken.
