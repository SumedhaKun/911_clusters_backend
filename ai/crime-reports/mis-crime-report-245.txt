POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case #2023-04785

Crime Type: Robbery

Date/Time: April 15, 2023 - 10:32 PM  

Location: 125 Oak Street, Oakwood City

Victim: 
John Anderson, 32 years old

Details of the Incident:

On the evening of April 15th, the victim, John Anderson, was returning home from his job at a local restaurant around 10:30 PM. As he was walking up the front steps to his residence, two unknown male suspects ambushed him from behind. 

The suspects gained access to the victim by following him home from work, waiting for him to arrive in a dimly lit area of the street. One suspect restrained the victim in a rear chokehold while the other suspect rifled through his pockets and belongings.

The suspects appeared to have access to tools commonly used to breach secure locations, such as a lockpick set and a small prybar, which they likely intended to use to enter the victim's home if he did not comply.

Force was used against the victim, as he was choked from behind until he stopped resisting. The suspects threatened the use of weapons, with one of them brandishing a switchblade knife.

After taking the victim's wallet containing $87 in cash, debit/credit cards, and other personal items, the suspects fled on foot down an adjacent alleyway. 

The victim sustained minor bruising and abrasions to his neck area but declined medical attention at the scene.

Evidence Recovered:
- Wallet (belonged to victim)
- Prybar (found near crime scene)
