INCIDENT REPORT

Case Number: 2023-04771
Crime Classification: Arson 
Date/Time Reported: April 15, 2023 / 2:17 AM
Location: 825 Main Street, Oakville

SUMMARY:
On the morning of April 15th at approximately 2:17 AM, the Oakville Fire Department received multiple 911 calls reporting a structure fire at 825 Main Street, a two-story commercial building housing a restaurant on the ground floor and offices above. Upon arrival, fire crews encountered heavy smoke and flames billowing from the rear of the building. 

After bringing the blaze under control, investigators from the Oakville Police Department's Arson Unit were called to the scene to determine the origin and cause of the fire. Evidence at the scene indicated a potentially incendiary fire had been intentionally set.

INVESTIGATION:
Witnesses reported seeing a lone individual dressed in dark clothing behind the building shortly before smoke was observed. Security footage from a nearby business captured video of a suspect entering the alleyway behind 825 Main Street carrying an object believed to be a lighter or matches based on witness statements. 

Approximately five minutes later, the same person is seen fleeing the area on foot as smoke begins emanating from the structure. Accelerant detection dogs were brought in and had positive alerts for the presence of ignitable liquids in the area where the fire originated.

Physical evidence recovered at the scene included:
- Burned matchstick remnants
- Gasoline residue on the exterior wall
- Pry marks on a rear door indicating forced entry

The fire caused significant damage estimated at over $300,000 to the building and businesses. Thankfully no injuries were reported.

The suspect remains at large and is described as:
- Male
- Approximately 5'10" - 6' tall
