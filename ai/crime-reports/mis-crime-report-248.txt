SUMMARY OF INCIDENT:
On April 21st at approximately 10:30 PM, officers responded to a call regarding a home invasion and robbery at 215 Main St, Apartment 3B. The victim, Jane Doe (28), reported that two unknown males had forcibly entered her apartment through intimidation and threats of violence. 

According to the victim's statement, she had just returned home from work and was entering her apartment when the two suspects approached her from behind in the hallway. One of the suspects grabbed Ms. Doe's arm tightly while the other brandished what appeared to be a handgun tucked into his waistband. 

The suspects then forced their way into Ms. Doe's apartment, using her keys that were taken at gunpoint. Once inside, the suspects bound Ms. Doe's hands behind her back with zip ties and forced her to the floor. They repeatedly threatened her with physical violence if she did not cooperate and remain quiet.

The suspects then proceeded to ransack the apartment, overturning furniture and taking valuables including jewelry, electronics, and cash totaling approximately $5,000 in estimated value. Fingerprint analysis revealed that common burglary tools such as a crowbar and lock pick set were likely used to access secured areas like the apartment's safe and lockboxes.

After approximately 45 minutes, the suspects collected the stolen goods into pillow cases and fled the apartment on foot. Neighbors did not report hearing any signs of a struggle or commotion during the incident. 

The victim describes the suspects as follows:

Suspect #1: Male, 25-30 years old, 6' tall, athletic build, dark clothing, ski mask
Suspect #2: Male, 30-35 years old, 5'8" tall, stocky build, blue jeans, black hoodie

The investigation is ongoing and police are canvassing the area for any witnesses or surveillance footage that may aid in identifying the suspects. The public is advised that the suspects are considered armed and dangerous. Anyone with information is urged to contact the Cityville Police Department immediately.
