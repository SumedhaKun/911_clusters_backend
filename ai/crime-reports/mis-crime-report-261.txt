POLICE REPORT
Case #2023-04-117
Crime: Robbery

On the night of April 12th, 2023, a daring robbery took place at the First National Bank in downtown Metropolis. According to witness statements and evidence collected at the scene, the events unfolded as follows:

At approximately 11:45 PM, a group of four suspects, their faces concealed by ski masks, breached the bank's security perimeter. The perpetrators employed sophisticated methods to gain access, including lock-picking tools and a commercial-grade thermal lance to cut through the reinforced vault door.

Once inside the vault, the robbers subdued the two night guards on duty using non-lethal force, including tasers and zip ties to restrain them. Witnesses reported hearing the distinct sound of suppressed gunfire, indicating that the suspects were armed with silenced weapons, likely pistols.

The suspects then proceeded to empty the vault's contents into duffel bags, making off with an estimated $5.2 million in cash, bearer bonds, and other valuables. Security footage captured the robbers loading the haul into a black unmarked van parked in the alleyway behind the bank.

The meticulous nature of the heist, the advanced tools used, and the military-style execution suggest that this was the work of a highly organized and experienced criminal syndicate. Forensic teams are currently scouring the crime scene for additional clues and evidence that may lead to the identification and apprehension of the suspects.

The investigation remains ongoing, and authorities are urging anyone with information about this daring bank robbery to come forward and assist in bringing these dangerous criminals to justice.
