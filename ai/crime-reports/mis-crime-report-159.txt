POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case #2023-0418-732

Crime Type: Burglary/Home Invasion

On April 18th, 2023 at approximately 2:15 AM, officers responded to a 911 call reporting a home invasion in progress at 457 Oak Tree Lane. Upon arrival, officers observed signs of forced entry through the front door and apprehended two suspects fleeing the scene on foot. 

The victims, a family of four, reported being awoken by loud noises coming from the first floor of their residence. The male homeowner went to investigate and was confronted by two masked intruders who had gained entry by using a crowbar to pry open the front door. One of the suspects struck the homeowner in the head with the crowbar, rendering him unconscious.

The intruders then proceeded upstairs where they located the mother and two children, ages 8 and 11, in their bedrooms. Brandishing knives taken from the kitchen, the suspects bound and gagged the mother and children using torn bed sheets.

The suspects spent approximately 30 minutes ransacking the residence, stealing cash, jewelry, electronics and other valuables before attempting to flee the scene when they heard sirens approaching. No firearms were discharged during the incident.

Evidence collected at the scene includes the crowbar used for forced entry, torn bedding material, bloodstains, and fingerprints. The victims were transported to Mercy Hospital for treatment of non-life threatening injuries.

The two suspects have been identified as:
John Doe, 32 years old
Robert Smith, 28 years old

Both suspects are being charged with aggravated burglary, armed robbery, aggravated assault, and felony possession of burglary tools. They are being held without bail pending arraignment.

This case remains an active investigation as officers attempt to determine if this incident is related to other recent home invasions in the area.
