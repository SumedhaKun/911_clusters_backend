POLICE INCIDENT REPORT 
Case #: 2023-04157

Crime Type: Residential Burglary 

On April 15th, 2023 at approximately 2:37 AM, officers responded to a call regarding a burglary in progress at 415 Oak Tree Lane. Upon arrival, officers discovered signs of forced entry through a rear window of the residence.

The victim, Jane Doe (32), stated that she was awoken by loud noises coming from the kitchen area. Ms. Doe called 911 and sheltered in place in her upstairs bedroom closet until police arrived. 

Evidence at the scene indicates that the perpetrator(s) utilized common burglary tools such as a pry bar and glass cutter to gain entry through the window. Once inside, the burglar(s) ransacked the home, overturning furniture and stealing a variety of valuables including jewelry, electronics, and cash totaling approximately $17,500 in losses.

Alarmingly, the burglar(s) were also armed with a crowbar which they likely intended to use as a weapon if confronted by the homeowner or police. Fortunately, no one was harmed during the incident. 

Forensic technicians processed the scene and collected potential DNA evidence from the pry tool and window frame. Canvassing of the neighborhood is underway and the investigation is ongoing. Anyone with information about this crime is urged to contact the Police Department's tip line.
