On April 16th, 2023 at approximately 2:30 AM, a burglary occurred at the residence of John and Jane Doe. The perpetrator(s) gained access to the home by picking the lock on the front door, a common mode of accessing a victim's property and a tool frequently used to access secure locations. 

Once inside, the suspect(s) did not use any type of force beyond the initial breaking and entering. No weapons were brandished or utilized during the commission of this crime.

The burglars made their way through the first floor of the home, rifling through drawers, cabinets and closets. Various items of value were taken, including:

- $300 in cash from Mr. Doe's wallet

Forensic teams processed the scene and found several viable fingerprints and shoe impressions which are being analyzed. Neighbors reported seeing a dark colored SUV parked on the street around the time of the incident, but no license plate or descriptors of the potential suspects were obtained.

The investigation is ongoing. Anyone with information about this crime is urged to contact the Anytown Police Department at 555-CRIME.
