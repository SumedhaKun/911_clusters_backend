Case #: 2023-04182
Date: April 18, 2023

Nature of the Crime: Burglary

On April 18th, 2023 at approximately 2:15 AM, officers responded to a report of a burglary in progress at 215 Maple Street. Upon arrival, officers found the front window smashed and signs of a forced entry. 

The homeowner, John Smith, age 45, reported that he was awoken by a loud crashing noise coming from downstairs. When Mr. Smith went to investigate, he was confronted by an unknown male suspect armed with a large kitchen knife. 

The suspect, described as a white male in his 30s, approximately 6 feet tall with a muscular build, gained entry by using a crowbar to break the front window. Once inside, the suspect physically assaulted Mr. Smith, striking him in the face and restraining him on the floor.

While restraining the homeowner, the suspect proceeded to ransack the home, stealing a 55-inch flat screen TV, an Xbox game console, jewelry valued at over $5,000, and $300 in cash. The suspect then fled the scene on foot heading west on Maple Street. 

A neighbor's home security camera captured footage of a white Ford F-150 pickup truck parked near the residence around the time of the incident. Officers are reviewing the footage for potential evidence.

Mr. Smith sustained a broken nose, black eye, and multiple contusions but declined medical treatment at the scene. The suspect is still at large and considered armed and dangerous. 

The investigation is ongoing. Anyone with information is urged to contact the police department's tip line. A $5,000 reward is being offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the suspect.
