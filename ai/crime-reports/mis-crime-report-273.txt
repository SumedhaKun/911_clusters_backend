POLICE INCIDENT REPORT

Case Number: 2023-04187

Crime Type: Aggravated Burglary  

Date/Time: April 17, 2023 - 2:16 AM

Location: 415 Oak Tree Lane, Oakwood  

Victim: Sandra Williams, 37 years old

On April 17th at approximately 2:16 AM, officers responded to a 911 call reporting a home invasion in progress at 415 Oak Tree Lane. Upon arrival, officers found the front door had been forcibly breached using a pry bar. 

Inside, the victim Sandra Williams was located bound and gagged in her bedroom closet. She had visible bruising on her face and arms consistent with being physically assaulted. Williams was able to free herself after the suspects fled and call for help.

According to the victim's statement, she awoke to loud banging noises coming from the front of the house. Two masked suspects then kicked in the front door, brandishing a metal pipe as a weapon. The suspects confronted Williams in her bedroom, demanding to know the location of valuables.

When Williams was unable to comply immediately due to fear, one of the suspects pistol whipped her across the face with the pipe, causing a laceration above her eye. The suspects then bound Williams' hands behind her back and stuffed a rag in her mouth to prevent screaming.

Over the course of approximately 45 minutes, the suspects ransacked the home, stealing jewelry, electronics, cash and other valuables estimated at over $25,000 in total value. Drawers were ripped from dressers and the contents strewn about. A crowbar was also likely used to pry open a small safe that was found empty.

Forensics responded to the scene and gathered physical evidence including blood samples, fibers, fingerprints, and tool mark impressions from the pry bar and crowbar used to gain entry. The stolen items were documented and the home was processed for additional evidence.

The victim was transported to Oakwood Regional Hospital for treatment of her injuries which were described as non-life threatening. She is expected to make a full recovery.

The suspects remain at large and unidentified. They were described only as two males wearing dark clothing and ski masks. The investigation is ongoing by the Oakwood Police Burglary Unit. Anyone with information about this crime is urged to contact authorities immediately.
