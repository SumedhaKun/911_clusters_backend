Victim: 
John Roberts, Male, Age 32
215 Maple Ridge Road, Apartment 27B

On April 12th at approximately 11:38 PM, officers responded to a 911 call reporting screams coming from apartment 27B at 215 Maple Ridge Road. Upon arriving on scene, officers found the apartment door ajar and announced their presence before entering. 

Inside, they discovered the victim, John Roberts, lying unresponsive on the living room floor with apparent strangulation marks on his neck made by a rope. An ice pick was also found near the body with trace amounts of blood and hair. The Medical Examiner arrived and pronounced the victim deceased at 12:03 AM.

Evidence suggests that the perpetrator(s) gained entry to the apartment by using physical force to pick the lock on the front door, likely with tools such as a rope and ice pick found at the scene. Once inside, an altercation ensued resulting in the strangulation death of the victim with the rope.

Canvasses were conducted on neighboring apartments and units but no one admitted to hearing or seeing anything suspicious around the time of the incident. The crime scene was processed by forensics and samples were collected to be analyzed at the county lab.

The investigation is still ongoing and all leads are being pursued. No suspects have been named at this time. Anyone with any information regarding this case is urged to contact Detective J. Callahan at 555-0164.
