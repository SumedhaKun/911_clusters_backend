POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case No. 2023-07182

Crime Type: Burglary

Date/Time of Incident: April 18, 2023 - Between 10 PM - 2 AM 

Location: 458 Oak Tree Lane, Oakwood, California

Victim(s): John and Mary Roberts

On the night of April 18th, the Oakwood Police Department received a call from Mr. John Roberts reporting a burglary at his residence on Oak Tree Lane. Officers arrived on the scene at approximately 2:15 AM. 

Upon entering the premises, it was evident that a forced entry had occurred through the back door leading into the kitchen area. The wooden door frame was badly damaged, with clear marks indicating some type of prying tool like a crowbar had been used to forcibly open it.

Once inside, the burglars proceeded to ransack nearly every room in the house. Drawers were left open, contents strewn about, and furniture overturned. The victims' laptop computers, jewelry boxes, and a locked fireproof safe appeared to have been the main targets. 

The safe, which was bolted into the floor of the master bedroom closet, showed obvious signs of being opened by force. Burn marks on the door indicated an oxyacetylene cutting torch was likely used to eventually gain access. The safe was found empty, its contents stolen.

Surveillance footage from the home's security cameras captured two individuals dressed in dark clothing, gloves, and ski masks arriving at approximately 11:30 PM. They were carrying a large duffel bag and toolbox, likely containing their burglary tools like the cutting torch, pry bars, lock pick set, etc.

After disabling the exterior security cameras, the perpetrators spent nearly 2 hours inside ransacking the home before fleeing out the back door with the stolen goods loaded into the victims' stolen Mercedes sedan parked in the driveway.

Forensic teams were called in to gather evidence and process the crime scene. Fingerprints, DNA, and various other pieces of physical evidence have been collected and are being analyzed.

The burglars managed to escape with an estimated $175,000 worth of valuables including cash, jewelry, computers, and other electronics. The investigation is still ongoing as detectives work to identify the suspects.
