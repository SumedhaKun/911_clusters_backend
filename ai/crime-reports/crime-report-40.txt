Crime Type: Armed Robbery

Location: Smith's Grocery, 825 Oak Street

Summary of Incident:
On the evening of April 17th, the Smith's Grocery located at 825 Oak Street was the scene of a violent armed robbery. According to witness statements, two masked individuals forcibly gained entry to the business after closing hours by picking the lock on the back door using a professional lockpicking kit.

Once inside, the suspects confronted the night manager, Michael Roberts, who was conducting routine cleaning and inventory checks. Roberts stated that one of the suspects punched him in the face, causing a bloody nose and bruising, when he failed to immediately comply with demands to open the safe. 

The suspects then brandished a handgun and threatened to shoot Roberts if he did not provide access to the safe's contents. Fearing for his life, Roberts entered the combination, allowing the suspects to make off with approximately $17,500 in cash from the night deposit drop.

The suspects fled the scene on foot through the rear entrance. A review of surveillance footage shows the suspects were both wearing dark clothing, ski masks, and gloves, making positive identification difficult. The handgun used in the robbery was described as a black semi-automatic pistol.

Evidence collected at the crime scene includes the damaged lock from the rear entrance, footprints, the victim's bloodstains, and fingerprints. The lockpicking kit used to bypass the lock was also recovered.

Suspect description:
- Suspect 1: Approximately 6 feet tall, medium build, wearing black pants, jacket, mask, and gloves.
- Suspect 2: Approximately 5'8" tall, heavy build, wearing dark jeans, black hoodie, mask, and gloves.
