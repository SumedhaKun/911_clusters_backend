Location of Incident: 328 Maple St, Oakwood, OH 43221 (Oakwood Gas N' Go)

Summary of Incident:
On the evening of April 17th, 2023, at approximately 9:15 PM, a robbery occurred at the Oakwood Gas N' Go convenience store located at 328 Maple St. According to the clerk on duty, Mark Jenkins (28), an unknown male suspect entered the store through an unlocked front door. 

The suspect, described as a white male in his mid-30s, approximately 5'10" tall with a slender build and wearing a black hoodie, blue jeans, and sunglasses, approached the counter and demanded that Jenkins empty the cash register. The suspect kept one hand in the pocket of his hoodie, implying he had a weapon.

Jenkins complied with the suspect's demands out of fear for his safety. The suspect made threatening statements such as "Don't try anything stupid or I'll blow your head off." Once the cash register was emptied, totaling $387, the suspect demanded Jenkins also hand over his personal wallet and cell phone. Again fearing for his life, Jenkins surrendered these items to the suspect.

After obtaining the cash and Jenkins' belongings, the suspect slowly backed out of the store while continuing to issue threats. Jenkins was unable to get a look at any potential vehicle the suspect may have used due to the angle of the counter. 

Once outside, the suspect fled on foot heading eastbound on Maple St. Jenkins immediately called 911 after the suspect left and reported the crime. No customers were present in the store during the incident.
