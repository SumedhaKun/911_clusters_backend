Case Number: 2023-04281
Report Date/Time: 04/12/2023 02:15 
Crime: Aggravated Burglary 

Summary:
On the night of 04/11/2023, a crew of suspected burglars forcibly entered a high-end jewelry store in the downtown area through the use of physical force and common burglary tools. According to evidence at the scene, the perpetrators utilized a commercial-grade lockpicking kit to bypass the store's main entrance security system. Once inside, they smashed several glass display cases with a sledgehammer to gain access to the valuable merchandise. 

Multiple eye-witness accounts describe a group of 3-4 individuals wearing dark clothing, ski masks, and gloves. The suspects were seen fleeing the scene in a dark colored sedan, possibly a late-model Ford or Chevrolet. An undisclosed amount of jewelry, watches, and loose gemstones were taken in the heist. 

One of the burglars appeared to be armed with a small caliber handgun which was reportedly discharged once inside the store, though no injuries have been reported. Evidence of the discharged firearm was recovered at the scene. Detectives are reviewing any available security footage from the store and surrounding areas for additional leads.

The use of physical force to subdue any security personnel or other individuals present at the time of the incident cannot be ruled out based on the violent nature of this crime. The suspects are considered armed and dangerous. Any civilians who may have information about this incident are urged to contact the police department immediately.

Details of the Investigation:
• The crime scene has been processed by forensics technicians, who have gathered physical evidence, including fingerprints, hair and fiber samples, and footwear impressions. 
• Detectives have canvassed the surrounding area for any witnesses or security camera footage that may aid in identifying the suspects or their vehicle.
• A detailed inventory of the stolen merchandise is being compiled by the store owners to determine the total value of the items taken.
• Bulletproof vests and tactical equipment were used by responding officers, given the high risk nature of the call involving armed suspects.
• The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) has been contacted to assist with ballistics analysis and tracing any recovered firearms.
