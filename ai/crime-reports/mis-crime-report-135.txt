POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case No: 2023-04281

Crime Type: Home Invasion

On April 15th, 2023 at approximately 2:15 AM, officers responded to a 911 call reporting a home invasion in progress at 725 Oak Tree Lane. Upon arrival, officers discovered signs of a forced entry through the rear kitchen window. No tools were apparently used to gain access based on the scene.

The victims, John and Mary Davis, an elderly couple in their 70s, reported being awoken by loud noises coming from the kitchen area. Mr. Davis went to investigate and was immediately confronted by two male suspects who had made entry through the shattered kitchen window. 

Modes of Accessing Victims:
The suspects threatened the couple at gunpoint and ordered them into the living room area where they bound their hands and feet using zip ties they had brought with them.

Type of Force Used:
No major physical force was used against the victims beyond the restraints, however, the emotional trauma of being threatened with firearms was severe.

Weapons Used:
The suspects brandished semi-automatic handguns described as black in color, potentially 9mm caliber based on their size.

Once the victims were secured, the suspects spent approximately 35 minutes ransacking the home, looking for valuables. Items stolen included:
- Mrs. Davis's jewelry box containing an estimated $25,000 worth of jewels and heirlooms  
- The couple's personal safe containing $7,500 in cash and important documents
- Two laptop computers and an iPad

Before fleeing the scene, the suspects gagged the couple using towels from the kitchen. Neighbors became aware something was amiss when Mr. Davis managed to trigger a panic alarm once the suspects had left.

The suspects remain at large and a forensics team is processing the scene for evidence and fingerprints. The victims were shaken but did not sustain any major physical injuries. They have been transported to the hospital for evaluation.

This case will be assigned to home invasion detectives for further investigation. Increased patrol presence will be implemented in the neighborhood as a preventative measure.
