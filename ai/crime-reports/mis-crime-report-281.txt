On April 15th at approximately 9:30 PM, the victim (John Smith, 34) was at home watching television when he heard a loud bang at the front door. Two masked men then burst into the living room, one armed with a black semi-automatic handgun. The gunman pointed the weapon at Mr. Smith and yelled "Don't move! This is a robbery!"

The second suspect began ransacking the room, overturning furniture and smashing valuables while demanding money and jewelry. Mr. Smith complied, handing over his wallet containing $280 in cash and his wife's jewelry box.

After obtaining the valuables, the gunman pistol-whipped Mr. Smith across the face, rendering him unconscious. The suspects then fled the scene on foot.

Mr. Smith regained consciousness approximately 20 minutes later and immediately called 911 to report the incident. Responding officers found evidence of forced entry through the front door and the home ransacked. The victim was transported to the hospital and treated for a concussion and facial lacerations.

The suspects are still at large. Evidence recovered at the scene, including the distinctive lock pick tools and crowbar, are being processed for DNA and fingerprints. The investigation is ongoing.
