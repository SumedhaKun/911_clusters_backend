Summary:
On April 15th at approximately 2:37 AM, a group of three suspects forced entry into the Downtown Jewelry Exchange by using crowbars and hammers to break the reinforced lock on the rear entrance door. Once inside, the suspects subdued the overnight security guard, Mr. John Roberts, through physical force, binding his hands and feet with zip ties. 

The suspects then made their way to the main showroom, where they used sledgehammers to smash open the display cases containing high-end jewelry and watches. Brandishing handguns, the suspects gathered over $500,000 worth of merchandise into duffel bags.

Witnesses reported seeing the three suspects fleeing the scene in a late-model black SUV with no license plates around 2:52 AM. The suspects were described as follows:

Suspect 1: Male, 6 feet tall, medium build, wearing a black hooded sweatshirt, blue jeans, and a ski mask.

Suspect 2: Male, 5'8", heavy build, wearing a green camouflage jacket, black pants, black ski mask. 

Suspect 3: Female, 5'5", thin build, wearing a red hooded sweatshirt, black leggings, black ski mask.

The security guard was treated for minor injuries at the scene by paramedics. No shots were fired during the incident. Evidence collected includes tool marks on the door and display cases, zip ties, shattered glass, and shoe prints. The investigation is ongoing.
