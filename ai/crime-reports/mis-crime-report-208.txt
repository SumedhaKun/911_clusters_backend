POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case #2023-04187

Crime Type: Aggravated Burglary

On April 12th, 2023 at approximately 2:15 AM, officers responded to a call regarding a break-in at the First National Bank downtown branch. Upon arrival, the officers found signs of forced entry through the rear loading dock entrance. 

The perpetrators appeared to have used common burglary tools such as a prybar, lock picking kit, and a portable cutting torch to gain access to the secured area. Once inside, physical force was employed against the night security guard who was found bound and gagged in the vault room.

Video surveillance shows three masked individuals dressed in black tactical gear entering the premises. Two of the suspects carried crowbars and blunt objects believed to be used for intimidation and incapacitating the guard. The third suspect had a duffel bag likely to transport the stolen goods.

After disabling the guard, the perpetrators proceeded to the vault where they used an oxy-acetylene cutting torch to burn through the vault door hinges and lock mechanisms. An undisclosed amount of cash, safe deposit boxes, and other valuables were taken during the heist.

Forensics recovered partial fingerprints, tool marks, and burned materials from the crime scene which are being analyzed. The security guard was treated for minor injuries at the scene. 

The suspects remain at large and all available units have been advised to be on high alert. Any individuals with information about this crime are urged to contact the police department immediately.

End of report.
