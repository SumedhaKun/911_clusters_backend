POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case #2023-04151

Crime Type: Cyber Intrusion, Data Theft  
Date/Time of Incident: April 12, 2023 / Between 2:00 AM - 4:00 AM
Location: Lexcorp Industries, 344 Clinton St, Metropolis

On the morning of April 12th, the security team at Lexcorp Industries headquarters detected a breach of their network systems during a routine scan. An unauthorized intrusion was discovered, with evidence pointing to the theft of sensitive corporate data and trade secrets related to their research projects.  

The cyber criminals appeared to have gained initial access by exploiting a vulnerability in one of Lexcorp's web application servers using an exploit kit containing known software exploits. Once inside the network, they deployed customized hacking tools to elevate their access privileges and move laterally to other connected systems containing proprietary data.

The perpetrators exhibited an advanced level of knowledge in network penetration and maintaining a covert presence within the environment to avoid detection over an extended period. Forensic analysis is ongoing to determine the full extent of data exfiltration and the potential release of any stolen information on black markets or dark web forums.

Based on the tactics, techniques, and tools used, cybercrime analysts suspect the involvement of the nefarious hacking group "Xhibitionist" which has been linked to multiple high-profile cyber intrusions in the past year. This criminal collective is known to target technology and research companies through complex cyber attacks for the purposes of corporate espionage and data theft.  

The Metropolis Police Department's Cyber Crimes Division, in coordination with federal agencies, has launched an intensive investigation to identify and apprehend the individuals responsible for this incident. All available cyber forensic resources are being employed to gather evidence from the compromised systems.
