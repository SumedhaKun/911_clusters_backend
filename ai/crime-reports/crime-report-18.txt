POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case No: 2023-04107

Crime: Embezzlement 

Date/Time of Incident: Between January 1, 2022 - March 31, 2023

Location: Acme Corporation, 123 Main St, Anytown, USA

Victim: Acme Corporation 

Suspect: John Doe, 35-year-old, Former Financial Controller at Acme Corp.

Details:
Over an extended period between January 2022 and March 2023, the suspect, John Doe, allegedly embezzled funds from his employer, Acme Corporation. As the Financial Controller, Doe abused his authorized access to the company's financial accounts and computer systems.

An internal audit revealed discrepancies in the financial records, with large sums of money being siphoned out of the accounts into Doe's personal offshore bank accounts. Preliminary figures suggest the total amount embezzled could be in excess of $3 million.

Utilizing his computer access and knowledge of the accounting software, Doe was able to manipulate financial data to cover his tracks. However, a detailed forensic audit of the systems uncovered evidence of his illegal activities.

No force or weapons were used in the commission of this crime, as Doe simply abused his position of trust and authority within the company. He did not need to use any special tools beyond the company's computer systems he already had access to as part of his role.

The company has terminated Doe's employment and is cooperating fully with law enforcement authorities. Criminal charges of embezzlement, fraud, and money laundering are expected to be filed against the suspect.

Investigating Officers: Det. Sam Brown, Det. Janice Williams

Status: Open investigation pending arrest of suspect
