POLICE REPORT
Case #: 2023-04785
Crime: Burglary 

On the night of April 17th, 2023, a burglary occurred at 456 Maple Lane in the suburban town of Oakwood. The victim, John Smith, reported that upon returning home from work around 7pm, he discovered signs of a break-in at his residence. 

The perpetrator(s) appeared to have gained entry by forcing open a ground-floor window on the side of the house. Marks on the window frame indicate the use of lock picking tools to tamper with the latch initially, followed by brute force to completely break the window when lock picking failed. Shards of broken glass were found on the floor inside the home.

Once inside, the burglar(s) ransacked multiple rooms, leaving drawers open, contents strewn about, and furniture moved or overturned. Valuables reported missing include:
- A 50" flat screen TV 
- An Apple laptop computer
- An antique jewelry box containing various pieces of jewelry 
- Around $300 in cash from Mr. Smith's wallet

No other weapons besides basic tools like screwdrivers and pliers were seemingly used or recovered from the scene. The perpetrator(s) did not arouse any suspicion from neighbors, as no suspicious vehicles or persons were reported in the area that evening.

Evidence collected includes:
- Fingerprints lifted from the window frame and nearby surfaces
- Shoe prints and soil samples tracked into the home
- Fibers and hair strands found at points of entry

The burglary remains an open case as the investigation continues. Law enforcement is canvassing the neighborhood and reviewing home security footage from nearby properties. Rewards are being offered for any information leading to the identification and arrest of the suspect(s).
