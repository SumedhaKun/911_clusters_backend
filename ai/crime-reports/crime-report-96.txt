POLICE REPORT 

Case #: 2023-07182
Date of Incident: May 23, 2023
Location: Brewster County Border Patrol Checkpoint, TX

INCIDENT SUMMARY:
On the evening of May 23rd, Border Patrol agents conducting inspections at the Brewster County checkpoint made a startling discovery during a routine vehicle search. A white Dodge Ram pickup truck was found to be carrying an illegal cargo of undocumented immigrants being smuggled across the border from Mexico into the United States. 

DETAILS:
At approximately 8:15 PM, the pickup truck approached the Border Patrol checkpoint on Highway 90 outside of Alpine, TX. The driver, a Hispanic male in his 30s, presented a Texas driver's license to the agent. However, during the standard inspection, agents detected several toolbox compartments in the truck bed that seemed inconsistent with the vehicle's use. 

Upon closer examination utilizing a K9 unit, the agents discovered 12 individuals concealed within the various toolboxes in the truck bed. The individuals, a mix of males and females ranging from teenagers to middle age, were found to be Citizens of Mexico with no legal documentation to enter the United States. They had limited supplies of food and water.

The driver, identified as Juan Ramirez (35) of El Paso, TX, was immediately taken into custody. Ramirez had no previous criminal record but admitted under questioning to being paid $3,000 to transport the undocumented immigrants from Ojinaga, Mexico across the border to a residential address in El Paso. He claimed not to know the individuals he was transporting.

CHARGES:
Juan Ramirez has been charged with one count of immigrant smuggling (8 USC 1324) and one count of transporting undocumented immigrants (8 USC 1324a). 

The 12 undocumented immigrants from Mexico have been processed and are currently in custody awaiting deportation proceedings.

This investigation is still ongoing with Border Patrol Intelligence attempting to identify the larger smuggling organization behind this operation.
