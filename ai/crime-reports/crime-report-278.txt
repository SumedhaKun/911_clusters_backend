POLICE INCIDENT REPORT

Case No: 2023-07182
Report Date: 05/12/2023

Nature of Crime: Cybercrime 

On May 10th, 2023, the Cyber Crimes Division received a complaint from VictimCorp, a large financial services company. VictimCorp reported that they were the victims of a sophisticated cyber attack that compromised sensitive customer data.

According to the company's IT security team, an unknown perpetrator or group gained unauthorized access to VictimCorp's computer systems through cleverly designed phishing emails containing malware. Once the malware was deployed, the perpetrators were able to bypass security protocols and infiltrate the core databases containing millions of customer records.

The malware utilized appears to be a new, undetected variant that allowed the perpetrators to move laterally through the network while covering their tracks. Forensic analysis indicates the cyber criminals employed various obfuscation and anti-forensic techniques to thwart detection and hide their activities.

While no physical force or traditional weapons were used, the digital force and virtual weapons deployed by the cyber criminals proved extremely effective. Malicious code was injected into VictimCorp's systems, allowing the theft of over 20 million customer records containing names, birthdates, social security numbers, financial information and other personal data.

The stolen data has already surfaced on underground markets, being sold to other criminal groups and identity theft rings. VictimCorp is working with law enforcement and cybersecurity firms in an attempt to identify the perpetrators based on forensic evidence and track the data flow.

The financial and reputational damage to VictimCorp is still being calculated, but initial estimates put the cost of the breach at over $100 million due to legal penalties, credit monitoring services for affected customers, and damage to the brand.

This case highlights the evolving threat of cyber crimes in the digital age. While no physical violence occurred, the impact on VictimCorp and its customers could be devastating. Cyber criminals have shown they can inflict massive harm while operating remotely with just computers and malicious code as weapons.

The Cyber Crimes Division is coordinating with federal law enforcement agencies and cybersecurity firms in an ongoing investigation to identify and apprehend those responsible for this audacious cyber attack. All available digital forensic and intelligence resources are being employed to track down the perpetrators.
