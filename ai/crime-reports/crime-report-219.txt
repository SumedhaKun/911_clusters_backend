POLICE INCIDENT REPORT

Case Number: 2023-0415-VA

Crime: Vandalism 

Date/Time: April 15, 2023 / 2:17 AM

Location: 825 Industrial Way, Abandoned Factory Complex 

Summary of Incident:
On the night of April 15th, officers responded to a call regarding a break-in and vandalism at an abandoned factory on Industrial Way. Upon arrival, they discovered the west entrance had been forcibly breached with clear signs of a sledgehammer being used to smash through the metal door.

Once inside, a path of destruction was evident. Walls had been smashed and knocked down throughout the main factory floor, leaving debris scattered everywhere. All windows on the west side of the building were also found shattered, likely from repeated blows with the same sledgehammer used on the entrance.

No suspects were located on the premises, but evidence of the vandalism was widespread and obvious. Several security cameras were also purposely damaged, hampering the collection of potential video evidence. The factory has been vacant for over 5 years, so no personnel were present at the time.

Aside from the extensive property damage from the smashed walls, windows, and door, no other objects appeared disturbed or stolen. The perpetrators seemed solely motivated by mindless destruction and defacing of the abandoned locale.

The responding officers secured the scene and collected the sledgehammer and other potential evidence. The factory owners were notified about the incident. An investigation is ongoing to identify and apprehend those responsible for this brazen act of vandalism.

Reporting Officers: P. Henderson, R. Davis
