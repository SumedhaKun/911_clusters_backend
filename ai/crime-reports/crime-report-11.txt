INCIDENT REPORT
Case #: 2023-04621
Date: April 15, 2023
Location: 712 Fairview Ave, Abandoned Graystone Apartments

INCIDENT SUMMARY:
On April 15th at approximately 2:15 AM, officers responded to a call reporting vandalism and a possible break-in at the abandoned Graystone Apartments on Fairview Avenue. Upon arrival, officers discovered significant damage to the building's exterior.

The front entrance had been smashed open, likely by use of a sledgehammer based on the force required and the shape of the damage. All ground floor windows were shattered, with shards of broken glass littering the interior. The drywall in the main lobby had been heavily damaged, with large holes smashed through multiple walls.

Evidence at the scene indicated the perpetrator(s) had gained access by forcibly breaking through the front door using the sledgehammer found lying just inside. They then proceeded to vandalize the interior lobby and hallway areas by smashing holes in the walls and breaking out windows. No other tools or weapons were found.

Surveillance footage from a neighboring building captured an unidentified individual wearing a hooded sweatshirt and face covering approaching the abandoned apartments at approximately 1:50 AM carrying what appears to be a sledgehammer. The individual is then seen fleeing the area around 2:25 AM.

At this time, no suspects have been identified and the motive behind the seemingly random act of vandalism remains unclear. The case has been forwarded to the Vandalism Unit for further investigation. Increased patrol of the area has been implemented in case of further incidents.

EVIDENCE COLLECTED:
- Sledgehammer (possible tool used for break-in)
- Shattered glass samples
- Footage from surveillance camera
