INCIDENT SUMMARY:
On the morning of April 15th, officers responded to a report of a motor vehicle theft at the Oak Ridge Apartment complex. The victim, John Roberts (28), stated that he had parked his 2019 Honda Civic in the apartment's parking lot at approximately 10 PM the previous night after returning home from work.

When Mr. Roberts went to his vehicle the next morning to leave for work, he discovered that it was missing from its assigned parking spot. After briefly searching the area, he immediately contacted the police to report the theft.
