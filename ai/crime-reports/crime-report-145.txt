Summary of Incident:
On the night of April 12th, officers responded to a 911 call reporting screams coming from apartment #312 at 725 Maple Grove Lane. Upon arriving on scene, officers found the front door kicked in and gained entry. Inside the apartment, officers located the victim, Jane Doe (28), unconscious and badly beaten on the living room floor. 

The victim had visible bruising around her neck consistent with strangulation. A crowbar was found lying next to the broken window in the bedroom, the suspected point of forced entry. Bloody footprints leading from the window indicated the perpetrator entered through this window after prying it open with the crowbar.

A search of the premises uncovered a knife, suspected to be the weapon used to inflict several lacerations found on the victim's arms and torso. The knife had the victim's blood on the blade. No other weapons were found on scene.
