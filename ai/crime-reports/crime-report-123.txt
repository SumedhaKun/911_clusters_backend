POLICE INCIDENT REPORT 

Case #: 2023-04785

Crime: Burglary 

Date/Time: April 12, 2023 / Between 9:30pm - 11:15pm

Location: 572 Oak Tree Lane, Oakwood

Officer(s) Responding: Det. J. Kozlowski, Det. R. Martinez

Victim(s): Pamela and Michael Harrington, residents 

On the evening of April 12th, the Oakwood Police Department received a call from the residents of 572 Oak Tree Lane reporting a home invasion and burglary. Upon arriving at the scene, officers found signs of forced entry through a rear kitchen window. 

The victims, Pamela and Michael Harrington, reported that they had been out for the evening at a friend's birthday celebration and returned home around 11pm to find their home had been burglarized. They immediately called 911.

Evidence at the scene indicated that the perpetrator(s) gained entry by breaking the kitchen window with a blunt object, likely a crowbar or small sledgehammer based on the impact pattern on the glass. Shattered glass was present both inside and outside the window frame. 

Once inside, the burglar(s) appeared to have moved through the first floor of the home, rifling through drawers, cabinets, and closets. An antique jewelry box belonging to Mrs. Harrington was found smashed open on the floor of the master bedroom. Various pieces of jewelry were scattered nearby.

Drawers and contents were strewn about in other rooms as well, indicating the perpetrator(s) were looking for cash, jewelry, electronics, or other valuables. The homeowners reported a flatscreen TV, laptop computer, and portable speaker system were among the items stolen.

No security cameras were installed on the property, and none of the neighbors reported seeing any suspicious persons or vehicles in the area that night. The perpetrator(s) made no attempt to disable the home security system, simply bypassing it by breaking the window to gain access.

Forensic teams have collected fingerprint evidence as well as fibers and tool marks from the scene. The investigation is ongoing as detectives analyze the evidence to identify the suspect(s) involved in this case of burglary and theft.
