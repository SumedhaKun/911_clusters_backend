INCIDENT DETAILS:
On May 14th, 2023, the Cyber Crimes Division received a complaint from a 16-year-old female victim, Emily Roberts, regarding an ongoing cyberbullying campaign against her. According to the victim's statement, the harassment began approximately three months ago on various social media platforms, including Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok.

The perpetrator(s), who remain unidentified at this time, created multiple fake accounts to relentlessly post derogatory messages, memes, and manipulated images targeting Emily. The content of these posts was deeply personal, mocking her appearance, intelligence, and spreading vicious rumors about her private life.

Emily reported receiving an onslaught of threatening direct messages, some explicitly stating, "You should just kill yourself, you worthless piece of trash." Other messages contained thinly veiled threats of physical violence if she did not comply with the perpetrator's demands, which included sending inappropriate photos and videos of herself.
