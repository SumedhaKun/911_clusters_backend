INCIDENT REPORT
Case No. 2023-07182

Date of Incident: April 12, 2023
Location: City Hall, 100 Main St, Centerville 

SUMMARY OF INCIDENT:
On the afternoon of April 12th, a confidential informant came forward with allegations of widespread corruption involving several high-ranking city officials. The informant, who has requested anonymity, provided detailed evidence of bribery and abuse of power occurring over the past several years.

According to the informant, Mayor Robert Langdon and three City Council members - Janet Simmons, Michael Ortiz, and David Reardon - have been accepting bribes from local business owners and real estate developers in exchange for preferential treatment on zoning regulations, permits, and city contracts. 

The bribes allegedly consisted of cash payments ranging from $5,000 to over $50,000, as well as other valuable items such as luxury watches, vacation packages, and even a 2021 Mercedes-Benz sedan for Mayor Langdon. These bribes were purportedly delivered directly to the officials' homes, offices, or to intermediaries acting on their behalf.

In addition to the bribes, the informant claims to have evidence of the officials using their influence to push through zoning changes and development projects that benefited their bribe payers at the expense of the community's interests. Specific examples cited include the fast-tracking of the Riverwalk Plaza mixed-use development despite environmental concerns, as well as the re-zoning of the Old Maple neighborhood for high-density residential against the objections of long-time residents.

The informant has provided files containing emails, financial records, photographs, and audio recordings to corroborate the allegations. The District Attorney's Office has been notified and a full investigation by the Public Integrity Unit is now underway.

Investigating Officers: Det. Sarah Cooper, Det. Paul Daniels
