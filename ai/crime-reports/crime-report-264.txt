INCIDENT REPORT
Case #: 22-07485

Date/Time Reported: 04/17/2023 @ 08:32 AM  
Location: 123 Park Avenue, Oakwood, CA 

Reported Offense: Vandalism

Officer(s) Responding: P. Henderson (Badge #638)

Summary of Incident:
On the morning of 04/17/2023, officers were dispatched to 123 Park Avenue regarding reports of vandalism at Oakwood Elementary School overnight. Upon arrival, I observed extensive graffiti spray painted across the front exterior walls of the school building as well as several broken windows on the west side.

Further investigation revealed that unknown suspect(s) had used spray paint cans in various colors like red, blue, and black to deface the school property with crude words and symbols. Based on the message scrawled, it appears the act was potentially motivated by a student grudge against the school. 

In addition, blunt objects such as hammers or bats were likely used to shatter the windows on the west wing classrooms. Shards of broken glass littered the grounds below. No suspects were located at the scene upon police arrival.  

The school's security cameras were also vandalized and appeared to have been purposefully damaged to conceal evidence of the suspects' identities and actions. The total cost of damages is currently estimated at $15,000 for repairs and cleanup.

No weapons were seized at the scene aside from the spray paint cans and likely hammers or similar tools used to break windows. Physical force appears to have been exerted only to the extent necessary to commit the property damage.

Evidence Collected:
- 6 spray paint cans (red, blue, black)
- Shoeprint impressions 
- Samples of shattered glass

No witnesses were immediately located. The investigation is ongoing as police review security footage from nearby residences and businesses. Anyone with information is urged to contact the Oakwood Police Department.
