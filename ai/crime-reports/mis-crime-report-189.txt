Case #: 2023-0418-ST

Crime: Stalking 

Date of Incident: April 18, 2023

Victim: Jane Doe, 28-year-old female

Suspect: Unknown at this time

Details of the Incident:

The victim, Ms. Jane Doe, reported an ongoing pattern of stalking behavior that has been escalating over the past several weeks. Ms. Doe first became aware of the stalker's activities on March 25th when she discovered that her vehicle had been tampered with. The gas cap was removed, and there were signs that someone had attempted to gain entry into the vehicle.

Over the following days, Ms. Doe began noticing other suspicious activities. She found that her mail had been rifled through on multiple occasions, and items seemed to be moved or out of place in her apartment when she returned home from work. Additionally, she received several hang-up calls on her cell phone from an unknown number.

On April 5th, the stalking took a more sinister turn. Ms. Doe discovered a threatening note left on the windshield of her car. The note, which appeared to be composed of letters cut out from various magazines, read: "I'm watching you. You can't escape me." This deeply unsettled Ms. Doe, and she reported the incident to the police.

Since then, the stalker's behavior has continued to escalate. Ms. Doe has reported seeing an unfamiliar figure lurking near her apartment complex on several occasions. She has also received numerous disturbing emails and text messages from an anonymous sender, making veiled threats and references to her daily activities.

The most recent incident occurred on April 17th. Ms. Doe returned home from work to find that her apartment had been broken into. Although nothing appeared to be stolen, it was evident that the intruder had been rummaging through her personal belongings. A photograph of Ms. Doe was found on her bed, with a red "X" drawn over her face.
