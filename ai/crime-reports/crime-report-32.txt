POLICE INCIDENT REPORT

Case No: 2023-047592
Incident Type: Vandalism
Location: 315 Industrial Way, Vacant Warehouse 
Date/Time: April 12, 2023, 11:45 PM

Summary of Incident:

On the night of April 12th, officers responded to a call reporting suspicious activity at an abandoned warehouse located at 315 Industrial Way. Upon arrival, officers discovered that the building had been forcibly entered and extensively vandalized.  

The perpetrator(s) appeared to have gained access to the vacant warehouse by using a sledgehammer to break through a rear entrance door. Once inside, the individual(s) proceeded to cause substantial damage throughout the interior of the building. Multiple walls were smashed, leaving gaping holes, and nearly every window on the premises had been shattered.

Based on the evidence at the scene, it appears the act of vandalism was committed solely through brute force using the sledgehammer as the primary tool. No other weapons or tools were found, and there were no signs of theft or attempted robbery. The motivation seems to have been mindless destruction and defacement of the property.

The warehouse interior was covered in debris from the damaged drywall, insulation, and broken glass. Graffiti markings were also found spray painted on several walls, though the markings did not point to any known gang symbols or territorial claims. The estimated cost of damages is currently assessed at over $25,000.

Evidence Collection:

- Multiple fingerprint samples lifted from broken glass and damaged surfaces
- Footprint castings taken from disturbed dust on floors
- Graffiti markings photographed 
- Sledgehammer recovered from scene

The investigation is ongoing as officers continue to process the collected evidence and canvass for any potential witnesses in the area. The vacant warehouse did not have any operational security cameras on the premises.

Officers are looking for any information that may help identify the perpetrator(s) responsible for this extensive act of vandalism and property destruction. Anyone with knowledge about this incident is urged to contact the Police Department at ...
