INCIDENT REPORT
Case #2023-14159

Date: April 22, 2023
Time: Approximately 10:30 PM 
Location: 700 block of Main Street

INCIDENT DETAILS:
On the evening of April 22nd, 2023, at around 10:30 PM, the victim, John Roberts (35), was walking home alone from a local bar on Main Street. As he reached the 700 block, a male suspect approached him from behind and confronted him directly.  

The suspect, described as a white male in his mid-20s, approximately 5'10" tall with a slender build, was wearing a dark hooded sweatshirt and jeans. He brandished a small silver semi-automatic handgun and pointed it directly at the victim while demanding his wallet and phone. 

The victim complied out of fear, handing over his belongings which included a black leather wallet containing $85 in cash, various credit cards, and his Pennsylvania driver's license. He also surrendered his iPhone 13. 

After obtaining the victim's valuables, the suspect stated "Don't try anything stupid, and no one gets hurt." He then fled on foot heading westbound on Main Street before disappearing from sight.

The victim immediately called 911 from a nearby payphone to report the robbery. Police units responded and canvassed the area but were unable to locate the suspect.  No security cameras were present on that block to capture footage of the incident.

The victim was unharmed during the robbery, and the investigation is ongoing. Any persons with information about this crime are urged to contact detectives at 555-0199. A $1,000 reward is being offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the suspect.
