Police Report #2023-04671

Crime Type: Robbery 

On the night of April 12th, 2023, at approximately 2:15 AM, a daring robbery took place at the Gemstone Jewelry store located at 257 Main Street. According to the store's security footage, two masked individuals forcefully gained entry by using a crowbar to pry open the front door. 

Once inside, the suspects proceeded with an aggressive modus operandi, smashing several glass display cases with blunt objects. Multiple witnesses reported hearing loud bangs and the shattering of glass from within the vicinity of the store. 

The two perpetrators, both dressed in dark clothing and wearing ski masks, then began rapidly emptying the contents of the smashed cases into large duffel bags they had brought. Security footage shows them grabbing handfuls of diamond rings, necklaces, and luxury watches.

At one point during the heist, an employee who was working late emerged from the back room after hearing the commotion. One of the suspects brandished a semi-automatic handgun and physically assaulted the employee, striking them in the head with the weapon. The employee fell to the floor, bloodied but still conscious.

With their loot secured, the two robbers swiftly exited through the shattered front door and fled on foot down an adjacent alleyway. A sweep of the area by responding officers failed to locate the perpetrators. 

The total value of the stolen merchandise is estimated to be over $750,000. The injured employee was treated at the scene by paramedics for a severe laceration and concussion.

Detectives are reviewing the security footage and following up on any available leads. The investigation remains active and ongoing. Any individuals with information about this violent robbery are urged to contact the police department's tip line.
