POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case #: 2023-04785
Date: April 12, 2023
Crime: Witness Tampering

Summary of Incident:
On the morning of April 12th, officers responded to a call from Ms. Jane Doe, a key witness in an upcoming trial against alleged mobster Antonio "Tony Bananas" Bananelli. Ms. Doe reported that she had received a threatening phone call from an unknown number earlier that morning.

According to Ms. Doe, the male caller did not identify himself but warned her in a gruff voice "If you know what's good for you, you'll keep your mouth shut at that trial next week. We know where you live. We're watching you." The caller then abruptly hung up.

Ms. Doe was visibly shaken when officers arrived. She stated that this was not the first time she had been intimidated related to her role as a witness against Bananelli. Two nights ago, she discovered the mutilated corpse of a stray cat on her doorstep with a note reading "You're next."

Officers searched Ms. Doe's residence for any signs of illegal entry or tampering but did not find any physical evidence. The incoming call was likely routed through multiple burner phones to mask the identity of the caller.

Witness tampering is a federal offense and a common tactic used by organized crime syndicates to escape prosecution. Bananelli is believed to have ordered this intimidation attempt against Ms. Doe to prevent her from testifying against him at his upcoming racketeering trial.
