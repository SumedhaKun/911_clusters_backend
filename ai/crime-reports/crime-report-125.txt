Incident: Residential Burglary 
Date: April 22, 2023
Time: Approximately 2:15 AM
Location: 726 Oak Tree Lane

On April 22nd at around 2:15 AM, officers responded to a 911 call reporting a home invasion and burglary in progress at 726 Oak Tree Lane. Upon arrival, officers found the front window shattered with glass on the ground outside. 

The homeowners, John and Mary Smith, stated they were awoken by loud banging noises coming from the front of the house. Mr. Smith went to investigate and was immediately struck in the head by an unknown assailant who had used a crowbar to break the front window for entry. 

The suspect, described as a tall Caucasian male in dark clothing, then physically overpowered Mr. Smith and held him at knifepoint demanding cash and valuables. Mrs. Smith was brought down at knifepoint as well when she came to see what was happening. 

After taking approximately $2,000 in cash from a safe, several pieces of jewelry, and two flat screen TVs, the suspect fled out the broken window to a waiting vehicle parked on the street. Neighbors reported seeing a dark colored sedan speeding away from the area.

Mr. Smith sustained a laceration to the head from the initial attack but declined medical treatment. The suspect remains at large and an investigation is ongoing. Fingerprints and DNA evidence were collected at the scene. Anyone with information is urged to contact the police department.
