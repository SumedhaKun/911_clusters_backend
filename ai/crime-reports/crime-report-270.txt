INCIDENT DETAILS:
On the evening of April 12th, 2023, a violent carjacking incident occurred in the parking lot of the Midtown Shopping Plaza. The victim, John Davis (28), was returning to his vehicle, a 2019 Honda Civic, after shopping when he was ambushed by three armed assailants. 

According to the victim's statement, as he approached his car, the suspects emerged from behind a dumpster near his parking spot. One of the suspects, described as a tall Caucasian male in his 30s wearing a black hoodie, pointed what appeared to be a semi-automatic handgun at Mr. Davis and shouted "Don't move! Give us your keys!"

The second suspect, a Hispanic male in his 20s wearing a red bandana over his face, brandished a large hunting knife and forcibly took Mr. Davis's wallet, phone and car keys. The third suspect, an African American male wearing a dark blue jacket, stood watch.

When Mr. Davis hesitated, the suspect with the gun pistol-whipped him across the face, causing a laceration above his eye. He then shoved Mr. Davis to the ground and took his car keys from the second suspect.

The three perpetrators entered Mr. Davis's Honda Civic and fled the scene at high speed. Security footage shows the vehicle heading north on Main Street.
