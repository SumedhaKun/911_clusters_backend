Here is a detailed fictional police report for a cybercrime:

POLICE REPORT

Case Number: 2023-04281
Date of Report: 04/15/2023
Reporting Officer: Det. J. Kimball 
Precinct: Cyber Crimes Unit

INCIDENT DETAILS:
Type of Crime: Cybercrimes 
Location of Crime: Online/Remote

SUMMARY:
On April 12th, 2023, the Cyber Crimes Unit received a complaint from VictimCorp, a large financial technology company. VictimCorp reported that they had suffered a major data breach and theft of proprietary data and software code.

INVESTIGATION:
Through digital forensics investigation, detectives determined that an unauthorized party had gained remote access to VictimCorp's secure servers and network. The perpetrator(s) deployed sophisticated hacking tools to bypass VictimCorp's cybersecurity defenses, including:

- Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack to overwhelm network resources
- SQL injection exploits to access backend databases
- Malware/rootkits to establish persistent remote access 
- Password cracking tools targeting employee credentials

Once inside VictimCorp's systems, the perpetrator(s) established backdoor access, installed data harvesting malware, and exfiltrated over 20TB of sensitive data. This included:

- Proprietary software source code 
- Customer personal/financial records
- Corporate intellectual property and trade secrets
- Employee personal records

The total value of data and IP theft is currently estimated at over $100 million in losses to VictimCorp.

EVIDENCE COLLECTED:
- System logs and audit trails from VictimCorp servers
- Samples of malware deployed during intrusion 
- Cryptographic signatures potentially linking to known threat actors

SUSPECTS:
At this time there are no confirmed suspects, however the sophistication of the attack indicates an advanced persistent threat (APT) group, potentially nation-state sponsored. Digital forensic evidence is being analyzed for potential attribution to a known APT group.

The investigation is ongoing and the Cyber Crimes Unit is working in coordination with federal law enforcement agencies and cybersecurity firms to identify the perpetrators and recover the stolen data.
