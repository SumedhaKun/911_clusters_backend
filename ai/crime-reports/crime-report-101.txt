POLICE REPORT
Case No: 2023-04127
Crime: Arson

On the night of April 15th, 2023, the Centurion Apartment complex on 825 Oak Street became the target of a devastating arson attack. At approximately 2:37 AM, multiple 911 calls were received reporting thick plumes of smoke billowing from the building's east wing.

Fire crews arrived on the scene within minutes and battled the raging inferno for over three hours before finally bringing it under control. Unfortunately, the blaze had already caused catastrophic damage, rendering a significant portion of the complex uninhabitable.

Through initial investigations and eyewitness accounts, it became evident that this was no accidental fire. Evidence recovered from the scene pointed towards a malicious act of arson.

Surveillance footage from nearby buildings captured a hooded figure approaching the east wing entrance shortly before the fire broke out. The suspect was seen forcing open the door using physical force, likely with the aid of a prying tool. Once inside, the perpetrator is believed to have used a lighter or matches to ignite combustible materials, rapidly fueling the flames.

While no firearms or other weapons were involved, the arsonist's actions demonstrated a blatant disregard for human life. Miraculously, no casualties have been reported thus far, but several residents were treated for smoke inhalation and minor injuries sustained during the chaotic evacuation.

Investigators are currently scouring through the charred remains, collecting any available evidence that could lead to the identification and apprehension of the arsonist. The Centurion Apartment complex housed over 200 residents, and the resulting displacement has left many families in dire need of temporary housing and assistance.

The motive behind this brazen act of arson remains unknown, but authorities are not ruling out any possibilities, including potential links to gang activity or personal vendettas. A joint task force comprising of local law enforcement and fire investigators has been assembled to pursue all leads and bring the perpetrator(s) to justice.

Anyone with information regarding this incident or who may have witnessed any suspicious activity around the Centurion Apartments on the night of April 15th is urged to contact the tip line at 555-CRIME. A substantial reward is being offered for any information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for this devastating crime.

The investigation remains active and ongoing.
