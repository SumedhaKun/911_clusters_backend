SUMMARY: 
On the morning of April 15th, officers responded to a call regarding a residential burglary at 215 Oak Grove Lane. Upon arrival, they found clear signs of a forced entry through a rear window of the home.

The victims, John and Jane Doe, an elderly couple in their 70s, were asleep at the time of the incident. They awoke to loud noises coming from the first floor and immediately called 911. By the time officers arrived, the perpetrator had already fled the scene.

MODES OF ACCESSING VICTIM:
The burglar appears to have meticulously cased the home over a period of time to identify vulnerabilities and the victims' routines. Based on the lack of tools used, it seems the perpetrator relied on brute force and the element of surprise to gain entry through the window while the residents were asleep upstairs.

TYPE OF FORCE USED: 
Physical force was used to break through the window and gain entry into the home. The window frame showed clear signs of being forcibly pried open from the outside.

WEAPONS INVOLVED:
No weapons were involved or reported to have been used in the commission of this crime.

PROPERTY STOLEN/DAMAGED:
An initial sweep of the home found that the perpetrator had rummaged through the living room, kitchen, and study areas. Various drawers and cabinets were left open. The following items were reported stolen:

- Mrs. Doe's jewelry box containing various rings, necklaces, and earrings (estimated value $8,000)
- Two laptop computers 
- $300 in cash from Mr. Doe's wallet

The total estimated loss is approximately $10,000. There was also moderate damage done to the rear window and frame during the forced entry.

EVIDENCE COLLECTED:
Forensics teams have collected various fingerprints and shoe impressions from the scene. They are analyzing the evidence to potentially identify the perpetrator.

ONGOING INVESTIGATION:
Detectives are continuing to investigate this incident. They are canvassing the neighborhood for any potential witnesses or surveillance camera footage that may have captured the perpetrator. The burglary appears to be an isolated incident at this time, but police are not ruling out any connections to other recent crimes in the area.
