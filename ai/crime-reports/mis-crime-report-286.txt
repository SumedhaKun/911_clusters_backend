On the morning of April 15th at approximately 2:15 AM, officers responded to a report of a residential burglary in progress at 128 Oak Tree Lane. Upon arrival, officers found signs of forced entry through a rear ground-floor window. 

The residents, Mr. and Mrs. John Doe, stated they were awoken by loud noises coming from the kitchen area. Mr. Doe went to investigate and encountered two masked suspects inside the home. 

The suspects, described as two males in dark clothing, threatened Mr. Doe with a crowbar and demanded cash and valuables. Mrs. Doe was brought downstairs at gunpoint by one of the suspects who was armed with a semi-automatic pistol. 

The victims stated the suspects seemed organized and experienced, quickly locating and taking jewelry, electronics, and a lockbox containing cash. The suspects bound the victims with zip ties before fleeing out the rear door they had forced open earlier.

Responding officers conducted a search of the surrounding area but were unable to locate the suspects. Evidence recovered at the scene includes:

- Pry marks on a rear kitchen window indicating forced entry

- Shoe impressions and muddy footprints leading away from the rear door
- Unidentified fingerprints and DNA evidence 

The total loss is estimated at over $25,000 in cash, jewelry and electronics.
