Incident Summary:
On the evening of April 17th, a daring armed robbery took place at the Centerville Jewelry Exchange on Oak Street in the downtown area. According to witness statements and surveillance footage, two masked perpetrators gained access to the premises through forced entry, using a crowbar to pry open the back door to the building.

Once inside, the suspects immediately brandished their weapons - a semiautomatic firearm and a large hunting knife - and proceeded to smash several display cases with blunt objects. They methodically gathered an estimated $250,000 worth of diamonds, gold necklaces, and luxury wristwatches into duffel bags.

The store's owner, John Davidson, was closing up for the night when the robbers confronted him at gunpoint. Davidson was physically assaulted and suffered a laceration to the forehead from the butt of the firearm, but is expected to make a full recovery.

After clearing out the store's most valuable inventory, the perpetrators fled on foot, heading westbound on Oak Street. Police arrived on scene within 5 minutes in response to the security alarm but were unable to locate the suspects.

The Centervillle Police Department is asking for the public's help in identifying the individuals responsible for this brazen act. The first suspect is described as a male around 6 feet tall with a stocky build, wearing a black hooded sweatshirt, black pants, and black boots. The second suspect is described as approximately 5'8" with a slim build, wearing a green camouflage jacket, blue jeans, and white sneakers.

A reward of $25,000 is being offered for any information leading to the arrest and conviction of those involved. Anyone with knowledge about this crime is urged to contact the CPD tip line at 555-0198 or leave an anonymous tip at www.centervillepd.gov/tips.
