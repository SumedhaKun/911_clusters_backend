Location: 125 Oak Street, Apartment 3B, Oakwood City 

Victim: 
Jessica Martin, 27 years old

Details of Incident:
On July 18th at approximately 2:37 AM, officers responded to a call of a potential burglary in progress at 125 Oak Street, Apartment 3B. Upon arrival, officers found the front door ajar and signs of forced entry.

The victim, Jessica Martin, reported that she was awoken by strange noises coming from her living room. When she went to investigate, she discovered an unknown male suspect inside her apartment. The suspect did not use any physical force against Ms. Martin.

Based on evidence at the scene, it appears the suspect gained access to the apartment through lockpicking techniques. A professional lockpick set was recovered, suggesting the perpetrator had advanced skills for bypassing conventional lock systems.

No weapons were brandished or used during the commission of this crime. However, various items of value were reported missing from the premises, including:

- Apple MacBook Pro Laptop (silver)
- Black leather purse 
- Assorted jewelry (necklaces, earrings, bracelets)

The total estimated value of the stolen goods is approximately $3,500.

Forensics teams have processed the scene for fingerprints and additional evidence. Witnesses from neighboring apartments reported seeing a tall Caucasian male wearing dark clothing and a baseball cap leaving the area around the time of the incident.

The investigation is ongoing. Residents are advised to keep all doors and windows secured, and to report any suspicious activity immediately.
