Evidence at the scene indicates that a crowbar or similar prying tool was used to force open the back door. The door frame was severely damaged, with clear marks from the tool used to jimmy it open. Once inside, the suspect(s) smashed several glass display cases and made off with an estimated $175,000 worth of diamonds, gold jewelry, and luxury watches.
