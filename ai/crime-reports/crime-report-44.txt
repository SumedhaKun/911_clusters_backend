Unknown at this time

Details:
On the evening of April 21st, the victim, John Roberts, was brutally attacked after leaving Sullivan's Bar around 11:30 PM. Mr. Roberts stated he was walking to his vehicle parked on Main Street when he was ambushed by an unknown assailant in the dimly lit alleyway behind the bar.

The suspect, described only as a male wearing dark clothing, emerged from the shadows and began violently striking the victim repeatedly with his fists. Mr. Roberts was knocked to the ground where the assault continued with a series of powerful blows to his face and torso area. 

The victim stated no weapons were used, with the suspect relying solely on physical force during the vicious attack. Mr. Roberts suffered a broken nose, multiple facial lacerations, and suspected cracked ribs from the sustained beating before the assailant fled the scene on foot.

Potential motive is unknown at this time. No words were exchanged during the incident and the victim's wallet and other belongings were not taken. The attack appears to be an unprovoked, random act of violence.

Evidence collected at the scene included trace evidence of blood splatter and the victim's broken wristwatch. Detectives are reviewing available surveillance footage from nearby businesses for any leads on potential suspects.  

The victim was treated at Mercy Hospital for his injuries and released later that night. The investigation is ongoing...
