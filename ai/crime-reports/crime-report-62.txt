On April 15th at approximately 2:15 AM, officers responded to a call regarding a home invasion and assault at 125 Oak Street, Apartment 3B. Upon arrival, officers found the victim, Maria Gonzalez (32), bound and badly beaten. 

According to the victim's statement, an unknown male suspect gained entry into her apartment through the living room window by using a crowbar to force it open. The suspect then strangled Ms. Gonzalez until she lost consciousness. When she regained consciousness a short time later, she was bound with rope and a knife was held to her throat. 

The suspect demanded cash and valuables, which the victim complied with out of fear for her life. Approximately $3,000 in cash and jewelry was stolen. The suspect then struck Ms. Gonzalez in the head with the butt of the knife, rendering her unconscious once more before fleeing the scene.

- Pry marks on the exterior window frame consistent with a crowbar

- Shoe prints near the broken window (size 11)

The victim sustained serious but non-life threatening injuries including:
- Contusions and lacerations to the face and head
- Ligature marks on the neck from strangulation  
- Possible concussion

The suspect is still at large and described as a male, approximately 6' tall, muscular build, wearing a black ski mask, dark clothing, and gloves. The investigation is ongoing. Anyone with information should contact Detective J. Williams at 555-0194.
