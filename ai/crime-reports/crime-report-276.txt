POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case #: 2023-04215

Crime Classification: Homicide  

Date/Time of Incident: April 12, 2023 - Approximately 11:30 PM

Location: 125 Maple Street, Apartment 3B, Oakwood City

Victim: 
John Roberts, Male, Age 34

Suspect: 
Unknown at this time

Narrative:
On the evening of April 12th, police responded to a 911 call reporting screams coming from 125 Maple Street, Apartment 3B. Upon arriving at the scene, officers made entry and discovered the victim, John Roberts, lying on the floor of the living room in a pool of blood with visible injuries to the head. 

The apartment was processed and evidence collected indicates that the suspect gained access by strangling Mr. Roberts with a rope until he lost consciousness. The suspect then used an ice pick weapon to viciously strike the victim multiple times in the head, ultimately causing his death through blunt force trauma.

Bloody footprints were found leading from the body towards the bedroom area, indicating the suspect may have moved through the apartment after the attack. However, no valuables appeared disturbed and there were no obvious signs of a struggle, suggesting Mr. Roberts may have known his assailant.  

Neighbors reported hearing a commotion from the victim's apartment around 11:15 PM but did not witness anyone entering or leaving. The investigation is ongoing as detectives attempt to identify the perpetrator and establish a potential motive. Any persons with information about this incident are urged to contact the Oakwood City Police Department's tip line.

This concludes the incident report.
