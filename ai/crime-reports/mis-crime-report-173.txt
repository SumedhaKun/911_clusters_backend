POLICE REPORT: ARMED ROBBERY

On the night of March 12th, 2023, a daring armed robbery took place at the First National Bank branch located at 125 Main Street. According to witness statements and surveillance footage, the events unfolded as follows:

At approximately 10:45 PM, a group of four heavily armed individuals breached the bank's security perimeter. They employed a combination of lock-picking tools and a commercial-grade thermal lance to gain access through the rear entrance. Once inside, the suspects immediately subdued the two security guards on duty using tasers and zip ties, rendering them incapacitated but unharmed.

The robbers, clad in black tactical gear and masks to conceal their identities, swiftly made their way to the vault room. There, they utilized a high-powered cutting torch to burn through the vault's reinforced door. The suspects exhibited a high degree of proficiency, suggesting prior training or inside knowledge of the bank's security protocols.

Upon gaining access to the vault, the robbers emptied numerous safety deposit boxes and gathered stacks of cash from the bank's reserves. The total amount of money and valuables stolen is currently estimated at over $3.2 million.

During the heist, the suspects were armed with semi-automatic rifles and handguns, which they brandished openly to intimidate any potential interference. Fortunately, no shots were fired, and no civilian casualties were reported.

The robbers exited the bank through the same rear entrance they had breached earlier, leaving behind a trail of evidence, including discarded tools, clothing fibers, and a few spent cartridges from their weapons.

The getaway vehicle, a black unmarked van, was last seen speeding northbound on Main Street, evading the first responding police units.

An extensive investigation is currently underway, involving forensic analysis of the crime scene, canvassing for additional witnesses, and reviewing all available security footage from the area.

The suspects are still at large and are considered armed and extremely dangerous. The public is advised to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity or information that may aid in the apprehension of these individuals.

This armed robbery represents a brazen and well-coordinated attack on our financial institution and a flagrant disregard for public safety. The police department, in cooperation with federal agencies, is committed to bringing these perpetrators to justice and ensuring the security of our community.
