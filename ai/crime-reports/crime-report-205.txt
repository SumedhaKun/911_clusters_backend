INCIDENT DETAILS:

On April 18th at approximately 11:35 PM, officers responded to a reported armed robbery in progress at the Downtown City Bank on Main St. Upon arrival, officers observed the front glass door smashed in and signs of a forced entry. 

Witnesses reported seeing three masked suspects flee the scene in a dark colored sedan, speeding northbound on Main St. The suspects were described as wearing all black clothing and ski masks.

Inside the bank, officers found evidence of an aggravated robbery. Multiple bank teller drawers had been emptied out and a large amount of cash was reported missing (exact amount still being determined). The crime scene showed signs of physical force and intimidation tactics used against the bank employees.

Further investigation revealed that the suspects had utilized common hand tools, such as hammers and pry bars, to forcibly break the lock on the front door and gain access to the bank after closing hours. Once inside, the suspects brandished firearms and threatened the overnight staff, forcing them to open the vault and teller drawers.

Multiple .45 caliber shell casings were recovered, indicating at least one of the suspects discharged a firearm during the robbery, though no injuries have been reported at this time.

Evidence collection teams have processed the scene and recovered potential DNA samples, fingerprints, and surveillance footage from the bank's security cameras. The getaway vehicle has been issued an all-points bulletin.

This case has been elevated to the Violent Crimes unit and remains an active investigation as law enforcement works to identify and apprehend the armed and dangerous suspects involved.
