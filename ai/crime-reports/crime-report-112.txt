Here is a detailed police report for a cybercrime incident based on the provided parameters:

POLICE REPORT: CASE #20221105-CY-072

Crime Type: Cybercrime 
Date of Incident: November 5, 2022
Location: Global (Internet-based attack)

INCIDENT SUMMARY:
On November 5th, 2022, the Cyber Crimes Division received multiple reports from individuals and businesses regarding unauthorized access and data breaches into their computer systems and networks. After an initial investigation, it appears that a sophisticated cybercriminal group has orchestrated a widespread attack utilizing malware and targeted phishing emails as their primary modes of attack.

The perpetrators gained unauthorized access through security vulnerabilities and successful phishing campaigns that tricked users into providing login credentials or inadvertently installing malicious code on systems. Once inside the networks, the malware allowed the criminals to move laterally, escalate privileges, and exfiltrate sensitive data.

INVESTIGATION DETAILS:
Forensic analysis is ongoing, but preliminary findings indicate the use of a previously unknown strain of malware, dubbed "GhostWorm," that exhibits advanced capabilities to evade detection and maintain persistence on infected systems. The malware leverages rootkit functionality to hide from security software and has components to log keystrokes, conduct surveillance through webcams, and encrypt files for ransom demands.

Additionally, the criminals employed a new phishing technique utilizing legitimate-looking marketing emails with malicious attachments or links. When opened, these initiated the silent installation of GhostWorm on the recipient's machine. Targets appear to have been carefully selected across industries, indicating thorough planning and reconnaissance by the group.

CRIMINAL TOOLS & METHODS USED:
- GhostWorm Malware
- Sophisticated Phishing Campaigns 
- Rootkit and Persistence Mechanisms
- Keylogging and Surveillance Payloads
- File Encryption for Ransom Demands
- Network Lateral Movement Capabilities

TYPE OF FORCE: Digital Force - No physical force used; the attack was conducted remotely by compromising computer systems.

WEAPONS USED: None. This was a cybercrime with no physical weapons involved. The perpetrators utilized malicious code as their weapon to infiltrate systems.

ACTIONS TAKEN:
- Cyber emergency response teams have been deployed to assist affected organizations 
- Threat intelligence has been shared with private/public partners
- International law enforcement cooperation has been initiated to identify the perpetrators
- Victims are being instructed to reinstall systems from trusted backups as a precautionary measure
- Internet security firms are rapidly developing detection signatures and removal tools for GhostWorm

The investigation is active and ongoing. All available cyber forensic resources have been committed to identifying and apprehending the criminals behind this large-scale cyber attack. More details will follow as the situation develops.
