POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case #2023-0415-F

Date/Time of Incident: April 15, 2023 / 3:15 PM 
Location: 123 Main Street, Anytown USA

Offense: Forgery (Fraudulent Creation/Alteration of Document)

Summary of Incident:
On April 15th at approximately 3:15 PM, officers responded to a call from First National Bank regarding suspected forgery and fraud. Upon arrival, bank manager Jane Smith stated that earlier in the day, a male suspect entered the bank and attempted to open a new account using what appeared to be forged identification documents.

The suspect, who identified himself as John Doe, presented a driver's license and social security card that raised suspicions with the bank teller. Upon closer examination, it was determined that both the license and social security card had inconsistencies and signs of being altered or recreated using sophisticated printing and editing tools.

Video surveillance footage shows the suspect printing documents from a small portable printer in his vehicle before entering the bank. He is also seen handling specialized printing materials.

No force or weapons were used or threatened during the incident. The suspect fled the scene after his forged documents were questioned. He is still at large.

The suspect is described as a white male, approximately 5'10", 180 lbs, with short brown hair. He was wearing a red baseball cap, blue jeans, and a gray hooded sweatshirt at the time of the incident.

All forged documents and surveillance footage has been collected as evidence. An investigation is ongoing to identify and apprehend the suspect.
