POLICE INCIDENT REPORT 
Case #: 2023-04785

Crime Type: Burglary, Grand Larceny  

On April 17th, 2023 at approximately 2:30 AM, officers responded to a call regarding a break-in at the First National Bank located at 125 Main Street. Upon arrival, officers discovered signs of forced entry through the rear entrance of the building.

The crime scene investigation revealed that the perpetrators gained access by physically prying open the back door using a crowbar and a hydraulic jack. Once inside, the suspects proceeded to the vault room where they used an oxyacetylene cutting torch to burn through the 6-inch thick reinforced steel vault door.  

Inside the vault, over $3.2 million in cash, bonds, and other valuables were stolen from multiple safety deposit boxes. The boxes showed clear signs of being forced open, with bent metal and shattered locks on the floors. Gathered evidence indicates that the suspects employed a rotating diamond drill bit along with a stun gun to disable the electronic locking mechanisms.

Further investigation uncovered security footage from across the street capturing two individuals wearing dark clothing, ski masks, and gloves entering and leaving the bank during the time of the incident. The suspects were also seen loading large duffel bags into a dark colored van before fleeing the area.

Detectives are actively reviewing the footage and pursuing all available leads. Any individuals with information regarding this crime are urged to contact the police department's tip line immediately.

This is an ongoing investigation and no further details can be provided at this time.
