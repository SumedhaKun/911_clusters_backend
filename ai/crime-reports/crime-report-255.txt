POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case #2023-04281

Nature of Incident: Homicide 

On April 15th, 2023 at approximately 10:30 PM, officers responded to a 911 call reporting gunshots heard at 215 Oak Street. Upon arrival, officers discovered the body of a male victim, identified as John Doe (32), lying in a pool of blood in the living room of the residence. 

The victim appeared to have suffered multiple gunshot wounds to the head and torso area. The murder weapon, a 9mm semi-automatic handgun, was found lying next to the body. The victim was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics.

According to witness statements from neighbors, a heated argument was heard coming from the victim's residence earlier in the evening, followed by several loud gunshots. One witness reported seeing a tall male wearing a dark hooded sweatshirt fleeing the scene on foot immediately after the gunshots.

Upon further investigation, evidence of a forced entry was discovered at the rear entrance of the home. Pry marks on the door frame indicated an unknown tool was likely used to forcibly gain access into the residence. Once inside, the suspect appears to have confronted the victim directly, using physical force and gunfire at close range to murder Mr. Doe.

The victim had a history of domestic disputes, according to records, and a known affiliation with a local criminal organization. At this time, the motive appears to be related to an ongoing feud between rival gangs operating in the area. However, all possible motives and leads are being thoroughly investigated.

Evidence collected at the scene includes the murder weapon, spent shell casings, footprint impressions, fibers, and unidentified hairs. Forensic analysis is being conducted on all evidence in an attempt to identify the suspect(s) involved.

This case has been classified as an open homicide investigation. Any individuals with further information regarding this incident are urged to contact the Police Department's Homicide Division immediately.
