POLICE REPORT

Case Number: 2023-04617
Crime: Burglary (Residential)

On April 12th, 2023 at approximately 2:15 AM, officers responded to a call of a suspected burglary in progress at 415 Oak Tree Lane. Upon arrival, officers observed signs of forced entry through a rear window of the residence. 

The victims, John and Jane Smith, stated they were awoken by loud noises coming from the first floor of their home. Mr. Smith went to investigate and encountered two masked suspects in the hallway outside the master bedroom. One of the suspects was carrying a large duffel bag, presumably to store stolen items.

The suspects threatened Mr. Smith with a crowbar and demanded cash and valuables. Mrs. Smith stated one of the suspects held her at knifepoint while they ransacked the bedroom, taking jewelry, electronics, and approximately $3,000 in cash from their safe.

Evidence at the scene indicates the suspects gained entry by shattering the rear kitchen window with a blunt object, possibly a hammer or large rock found outside. Pry marks were also discovered on the window frame, suggesting they used a pry bar or similar tool to open the window fully.

The suspects are described as follows:
Suspect 1: Male, approximately 6 feet tall, medium build, dressed in dark clothing and a ski mask
Suspect 2: Male, around 5'8", stocky build, dressed in dark clothing and a balaclava

The suspects fled the scene in an unknown direction. Neighbors did not report seeing or hearing any suspicious vehicles in the area. The K-9 unit was called in to attempt to track the suspects but lost the scent trail after several blocks.

Forensic teams have collected various pieces of evidence from the scene including fingerprints, shoe impressions, and hair/fiber samples. The investigation is ongoing as detectives analyze evidence and canvas the neighborhood for any residential security footage.
