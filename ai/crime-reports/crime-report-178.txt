Location: 315 Waterfront Ave, Bayview City

Crime: Racketeering

Summary:
On the morning of April 16th, officers responded to an anonymous tip regarding suspected racketeering activity at a commercial property on Waterfront Avenue. Upon arrival, officers made contact with the property manager who stated that a business operating out of one of the office suites was believed to be an illegal gambling operation.

Further investigation revealed that the offices were being used to run an underground sports betting ring catering to high-stakes gamblers and money laundering. Surveillance had been set up monitoring the comings and goings of well-known organized crime figures. 

After obtaining a warrant, a raid was conducted on the property. Inside Suite 312, officers found a sophisticated illegal gambling den outfitted with live sports viewing stations, online betting terminals, money counting machines and record books detailing hundreds of thousands of dollars in illegal wagers.

Eight suspects were taken into custody without incident, including the alleged ringleader Antonio "Tony Bats" Rosetti, a reputed capo in the Giordano crime family. No weapons or other means of force were encountered.

Evidence seized included over $85,000 in cash, betting slips, computers, ledgers and other records. The suspects are facing charges including racketeering, money laundering, operating an illegal gambling business and conspiracy.

The investigation into the scope of the operation and other individuals involved is ongoing. More charges are pending against the suspects as the case proceeds.
