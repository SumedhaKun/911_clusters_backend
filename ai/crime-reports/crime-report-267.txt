POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case No. 2023-04637

Nature of Incident: Arson 

Date/Time of Incident: April 15, 2023 / 2:17 AM

Location: 458 Maple Grove Lane, Bloomington, IN 47404

On the morning of April 15th at approximately 2:17 AM, the Bloomington Fire Department received a 911 call reporting a structure fire at the residential address 458 Maple Grove Lane. Upon arrival, fire crews encountered heavy smoke and flames billowing from the rear of the single-family home. 

After establishing a defensive perimeter, firefighters were able to gain control of the blaze and extinguish it within two hours. Evidence at the scene indicated that an incendiary device had been used to intentionally ignite the fire at the rear exterior of the residence. 

Homeowners John and Emily Wilkins reported hearing a loud noise outside their bedroom window shortly before smelling smoke. They were able to safely evacuate the home along with their three children. Thankfully, no injuries were reported.

Fire investigators found distinct pour patterns and traces of an ignitable liquid on the exterior siding and ground at the point of origin, consistent with the use of an accelerant. A partially melted disposable lighter was also recovered nearby.

After processing the scene, arson investigators determined the fire was intentionally set by gaining access to the rear exterior of the home and using a lighter or matches to ignite an accelerant that had been poured against the structure. The total estimated cost of the damage is $175,000.

At this time, there is no evidence of forced entry into the home and no clear motive has been established. The investigation is still ongoing as authorities attempt to identify any potential suspects or witnesses. Anyone with information about this incident is urged to contact the Bloomington Police Department at 812-339-4477 or the anonymous tip line.
