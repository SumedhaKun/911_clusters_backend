Location: 548 Oak Tree Lane

Narrative:
On the morning of July 17th, officers responded to a call of a residential burglary at 548 Oak Tree Lane. Upon arrival, they made contact with the homeowner, Janice Miller (57), who reported that her home had been broken into sometime during the night.

Through the investigation, it was determined that the perpetrator(s) had gained entry by forcing open a ground floor window on the east side of the residence. Pry marks and a shattered window pane indicated that lock picking tools were likely utilized to bypass the locked window. 

Once inside, the burglar(s) proceeded to ransack several rooms, rifling through drawers and closets. Furniture was overturned and belongings strewn about haphazardly. Mrs. Miller stated that several pieces of jewelry, electronics, and a small lockbox containing cash were stolen from the master bedroom. 

No suspects were located on the premises, but evidence of the forced entry and physical disturbance throughout the home were consistent with Mrs. Miller's statement. Forensics teams recovered several sets of unknown fingerprints and footwear impressions from inside the residence. No murder weapons or firearms were discovered at the scene.  

The total value of the stolen goods is estimated at approximately $17,500. Mrs. Miller was unharmed during the incident.

Neighbors in the area were interviewed, but no one reported witnessing any suspicious persons or vehicles during the timeframe of the burglary. The investigation is still ongoing as detectives continue examining the recovered evidence for potential leads.
