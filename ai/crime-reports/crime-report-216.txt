INCIDENT DETAILS:

On April 15th at approximately 10:30 PM, officers responded to a report of an assault at 215 Maple St, Apartment 3B. Upon arrival, officers encountered the victim, James Rollins (28), with visible injuries to his face including a bloody nose and swollen left eye.

According to Mr. Rollins' statement, he had been home alone watching TV when he heard a knock at his apartment door. Assuming it was his neighbor, he opened the door without checking the peephole first. The suspect, described as a white male approximately 6 feet tall with a muscular build and short brown hair, then forced his way into the apartment.

Mr. Rollins stated that the suspect did not appear to be armed with any weapons or tools. However, the suspect immediately began assaulting Mr. Rollins with his fists, striking him repeatedly in the face and upper body. A violent physical altercation ensued as Mr. Rollins attempted to fight back and defend himself.

The suspect did not make any verbal demands or provide a motive for the assault. After several minutes, the suspect fled the apartment through the same unlocked door he had entered. Building security footage corroborates Mr. Rollins' account, showing the suspect calmly entering and then fleeing the building shortly after the time of the incident.  

Mr. Rollins was treated at the scene by paramedics for his facial injuries but declined further medical transport. The suspect remains at large and the investigation is ongoing. Detectives will be reviewing surveillance footage from nearby buildings and canvassing the area for any other witnesses.
