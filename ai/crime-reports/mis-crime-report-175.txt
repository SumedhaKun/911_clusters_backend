POLICE REPORT

Incident: Home Invasion and Assault
Date/Time: July 15, 2023 - 2:17 AM 
Location: 416 Oak Tree Lane

Summary of Events:
On the morning of July 15th, officers responded to a 911 call regarding a violent home invasion at 416 Oak Tree Lane. Upon arrival, they encountered the victims, John and Jane Doe, who had been severely beaten. 

According to the victims' statements, they were awoken in the middle of the night by the sound of shattering glass. Three masked intruders had gained entry by smashing a window in the rear of the home. No tools were used to access the secure location.

The perpetrators immediately set upon the victims, binding their hands and feet with duct tape. Brandishing no weapons, the assailants relied solely on brute force, repeatedly punching and kicking the victims about the head and torso. Mrs. Doe suffered a broken nose and fractured ribs, while Mr. Doe sustained a severe concussion and lacerations to the face.

After thoroughly ransacking the home, stealing cash, jewelry and electronics, the suspects fled the scene on foot. Neighbors reported hearing raised voices and a vehicle speeding away, but no one got a clear look at the getaway car.

The victims were transported to Mercy General Hospital where they were treated for their injuries. The crime scene was processed by forensics, but no fingerprints or DNA evidence was recovered due to the perpetrators' use of gloves and masks.

At this time, the suspects remain at large and the investigation is ongoing. The police are urging anyone with information about this vicious home invasion to please come forward. A $10,000 reward has been offered for any tips leading to the identification and arrest of those responsible.
