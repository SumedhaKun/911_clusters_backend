POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case No: 2023-14875

Crime Type: Burglary 

Date/Time of Incident: April 12, 2023 / Between 1:00 AM - 3:30 AM

Location: 415 Oak Tree Lane, Oakwood

Victim(s): James and Linda Peterson, residents

On the morning of April 12th, at approximately 4:15 AM, the Oakwood Police Department received a call from a distraught Linda Peterson reporting a burglary at her residence. Upon arrival, officers found clear signs of unlawful entry and theft. 

The primary point of entry appears to have been the rear kitchen window, which was found shattered. Based on the evidence, it seems the perpetrator(s) used a crowbar or similar prying tool to force open the window from the outside. Once inside, the burglar(s) made their way through the first floor, damaging several interior doors that were locked.

Multiple rooms were ransacked, with drawers pulled out, furniture overturned, and belongings strewn about. The master bedroom appeared to be the most disturbed area. The victims' jewelry box was empty and a locked safe had been cracked open, likely using a power tool of some kind based on the markings. 

Among the items stolen were jewelry valued at approximately $25,000, rare coin collections, electronics including laptops and tablets, and cash totaling around $5,000. The victims were upstairs sleeping during the incident and did not wake until after the burglar(s) had fled.

No suspects are currently in custody. Evidence including tool marks, shoeprints, and fingerprints have been collected from the scene and submitted to the forensics lab for analysis. The neighborhood is being canvassed for any home surveillance footage that may have captured the perpetrator(s). 

Anyone with information about this incident is urged to contact the Oakwood Police Department's tip line at 555-0195. A reward is being offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the responsible parties.
