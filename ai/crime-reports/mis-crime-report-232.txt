POLICE REPORT
Case #: 2023-0416-078

Crime Type: Burglary

On April 16th, 2023 at approximately 2:15 AM, officers responded to a residential alarm at 415 Oak Tree Lane. Upon arrival, they discovered signs of a break-in through the back door of the single-family home. 

The homeowners, John and Jane Smith, were out of town at the time. Fortunately, their 16-year-old son Tommy was home alone and unharmed, though visibly shaken by the incident.

Modes of Accessing the Victim:
According to Tommy's statement, he was awoken around 2 AM by loud noises coming from downstairs. He crept partway down the stairs and witnessed two individuals dressed in dark clothing and ski masks ransacking the living room. The perpetrators did not appear to use any type of force to gain entry, suggesting they may have picked the lock or found another non-destructive way inside.

Common Tools Used to Access Secure Locations:
Forensics teams discovered markings on the back door's lock consistent with the use of lock picking tools. Spare keys were also missing from a small bowl near the entrance, indicating the criminals may have conducted preliminary surveillance and copied a key to make unlawful entry easier.

Type of Force Used: No force

Weapons Used in the Crime: None observed or reported

While no weapons were brandished, the criminals made off with a large flatscreen TV, an Xbox game console, jewelry from Jane Smith's dresser, and about $300 in cash from John's wallet. Estimated losses are around $4,000.

Canvassing of neighbors yielded a potential lead - one resident reported seeing an older model green sedan parked on the street around 1:30 AM, which then sped off shortly after 2 AM. The investigation is ongoing as forensics teams process evidence collected at the scene.

The Smith family has been understandably distraught over this invasion of their home and personal property. Police are increasing patrol presence in the neighborhood and urging citizens to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity immediately.
