Date of Incident: April 17, 2023
Location: 215 Oak Street, Apartment 3B

Nature of Crime: Robbery 

Details of the Incident:

On the evening of April 17th, 2023, at approximately 9:15 PM, the victim, Sarah Jenkins (28), was returning to her apartment after work. As she approached the door to her unit, an unknown male suspect confronted her from behind. The suspect had allegedly picked the lock to gain entry into the building's vestibule area earlier that evening. 

According to Ms. Jenkins' statement, the suspect was carrying a lock pick set which he likely used to bypass the security locks. Once inside the vestibule, he laid in wait for a resident to enter. When Ms. Jenkins arrived, the suspect grabbed her from behind, placed a handgun against her back, and threatened to shoot if she did not cooperate.

Fearing for her life, the victim complied with the suspect's demands. He forced her into her apartment at gunpoint and once inside, ordered her to open a safe located in the bedroom closet. Ms. Jenkins stated that the safe contained jewelry, cash, and other valuables estimated at over $25,000.

After taking the contents of the safe, the armed suspect bound the victim's hands and feet with duct tape he found inside the apartment. He then made his escape, leaving the victim restrained until she was discovered several hours later by a neighbor who heard faint cries for help.

The suspect remains at large and is described as a white male, approximately 6 feet tall, with a medium build. He was last seen wearing a dark hoodie, blue jeans, and sneakers. The suspect is considered armed and extremely dangerous.

Anyone with information regarding this incident is urged to contact the police department's robbery division immediately.

Case remains open and active.
