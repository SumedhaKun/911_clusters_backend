POLICE REPORT

Case #: 2023-04785
Crime: Perjury 

Summary of Incident:
On April 15th, 2023, a perjury case came to light during the highly publicized trial of alleged mob boss Antonio Ricci. The incident occurred when key witness Vincent Gagliardi took the stand to testify against Ricci. During intense cross-examination by the defense attorney, Gagliardi's testimony contained numerous contradictions and fabrications that amounted to perjury.

Gagliardi, an ex-bookkeeper for the Ricci crime family, had agreed to become a cooperating witness for the prosecution in exchange for leniency. However, under oath, he drastically altered previous statements made during the investigation. Gagliardi denied any knowledge of Ricci's involvement in racketeering, extortion, and money laundering activities that he had explicitly detailed in recorded interviews.  

When confronted with transcripts of his original testimony that contradicted his new claims, Gagliardi stated "I don't recall" or "I must have been mistaken" repeatedly. The prosecution played audio recordings further highlighting the discrepancies in his testimony. It became evident Gagliardi had lied under oath in an attempt to protect Ricci.

No physical weapons or tools were used in the commission of this perjury. However, Gagliardi's false statements while under oath amounted to a breach of the justice system through willful deceit.  

The defense promptly moved for a mistrial based on the credibility issues with the prosecution's star witness. The judge denied the request but struck Gagliardi's entire testimony from the record, dealing a major blow to the prosecution's case against Ricci.

Perjury charges are pending review by the District Attorney's office against Vincent Gagliardi. Authorities believe he may have been coerced or paid by the Ricci family to change his testimony, further compromising the integrity of the trial.  

This case remains open as the investigation into the motives behind Gagliardi's lie under oath continues...
