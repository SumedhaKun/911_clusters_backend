POLICE REPORT
Case #: 2023-04785

Crime Type: Homicide

On the evening of May 15th, 2023, officers responded to a 911 call reporting gunshots at 514 Maple Lane. Upon arrival, they discovered the body of Vincent Moretti, a 37-year-old male, lying in a pool of blood in the living room of the residence. 

The victim appeared to have suffered multiple gunshot wounds to the chest and head area. The murder weapon, a .38 caliber revolver, was found lying next to the body. Forensics will be examining the firearm for fingerprints and gunshot residue.

According to witness statements from neighbors, two masked individuals were seen fleeing the premises just after the gunshots were heard. One was described as a tall male wearing a dark hooded sweatshirt, and the other a shorter individual of unconfirmed gender dressed in black clothing. 

No signs of forced entry were found, leading investigators to believe the perpetrators may have gained access by killing Mr. Moretti when he answered the door. The motive is currently unknown, but robbery does not appear to be the cause as the residence was untouched. 

Homicide detectives are exploring all possible angles, including checking for any connections to organized crime that the victim may have had. Mr. Moretti had a record of minor offenses but no known ties to major criminal enterprises.

The body has been transported to the medical examiner's office for an autopsy to determine the official cause of death. The investigation remains active and ongoing as authorities work to identify the suspects and bring them into custody.

Anyone with information about this incident is urged to contact the police department's tip line immediately.
