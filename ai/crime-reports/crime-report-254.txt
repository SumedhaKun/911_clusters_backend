POLICE REPORT
Case No: 2023-0416-IT

Crime: Insider Trading  

Date/Time of Offense: Between April 1-15, 2023

Location: New York City, NY

Summary of Offense:
This case involves allegations of insider trading against the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of GeneTech Pharmaceuticals Inc., Robert Kingsley. It is suspected that Mr. Kingsley engaged in the unauthorized use of confidential corporate information to illegally trade company securities for personal financial gain.

Details:
On April 18th, 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) received a tip from a whistleblower regarding suspected insider trading activities at GeneTech Pharmaceuticals. The tip alleged that the company's CFO, Robert Kingsley, had been trading GeneTech stock based on non-public information about an undisclosed failed drug trial.

An investigation was immediately launched, which uncovered the following evidence implicating Mr. Kingsley:

- Trading records show that on April 3rd, 2023, Mr. Kingsley sold 100,000 shares of GeneTech stock for $5.2 million. This transaction occurred just days before GeneTech publicly announced the failed Phase III trial results of their potential blockbuster drug GX579 on April 17th. After this announcement, GeneTech's stock price plummeted over 40%.

- Email and phone records indicate that Mr. Kingsley was made aware of the negative trial data on March 31st, one week before executing the large stock sale. As CFO, he had access to this confidential information before it was publicly released.

- Bank statements reveal that on April 5th, shortly after the stock sale, Mr. Kingsley wired $4 million from his brokerage account to an offshore account in the Cayman Islands.

- A search of Mr. Kingsley's office uncovered hand-written notes with details about the failed GX579 trial and projected stock price impacts.

No weapons or force were used to perpetrate this non-violent financial crime. The insider trading scheme relied solely on Mr. Kingsley's unauthorized use of confidential corporate information for illegal securities trading.

The SEC has frozen Mr. Kingsley's accounts and assets pending further legal action. He could face charges of securities fraud, which carries penalties of up to 20 years in prison and $5 million in fines.

This report has been prepared by Detective Michael Norris, Financial Crimes Unit, based on evidence collected during the ongoing investigation.
