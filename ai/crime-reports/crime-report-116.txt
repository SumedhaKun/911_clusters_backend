INCIDENT SUMMARY:
On the evening of April 17th, a daring armed robbery took place in the downtown area. Three suspects, described as wearing dark clothing and ski masks, allegedly stole a black Ford F-150 pickup truck earlier that night. They then used the stolen vehicle to commit a drive-by robbery at a busy intersection. 

According to witness statements, the suspects pulled up next to a red Toyota Camry that was stopped at a traffic light. Two of the suspects exited the truck, brandishing semi-automatic handguns. They approached the Camry, smashed the driver's side window, and forcibly removed the driver and passenger at gunpoint. 

The victims, a married couple in their 60s, stated the suspects threatened them with violence if they did not comply and hand over their valuables. Fearing for their lives, the couple surrendered their wallet, purse, jewelry and cell phones to the armed assailants. 

After obtaining the victims' belongings, the suspects fled the scene in the stolen truck, narrowly avoiding an incoming police cruiser. The direction of their travel is currently unknown. Evidence recovered at the crime scene includes the shattered glass and a discharged firearm casing.
