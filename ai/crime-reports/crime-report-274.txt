POLICE REPORT #2023-0415

Date: April 15, 2023
Crime: Forgery 

INCIDENT DETAILS:
On the evening of April 14th, 2023, the Centra City Police Department received a report of suspected forgery from First National Bank. Bank employees noticed irregularities with several loan documents that had been recently processed.

Upon investigation, it was discovered that a former bank employee, John Smith (35), had created fraudulent loan documents in order to embezzle funds from the bank. Smith had resigned from his position as a loan officer two months prior.

Smith utilized his prior access to the bank's computer systems, printers, and document supplies to craft remarkably realistic loan approval documents. He then allegedly deposited the fraudulent loan amounts into several personal accounts he controlled.

The forged documents were extremely well-made, making use of bank logos, watermarks, and other anti-counterfeiting designs the bank typically uses. Forensic analysis determined the documents were printed on the same type of specialized paper stock the bank uses.

No other suspects are believed to be involved at this time. No threats or force were used during the commission of this crime.

EVIDENCE SEIZED:
- Laptop and desktop computers from Smith's residence
- External hard drives 
- Printers and printer supplies
- Blank bank documentation paper
- $127,000 in cash from Smith's home safe

Smith was arrested without incident at his residence and is currently being held on $500,000 bond. He has been charged with forgery, embezzlement, theft, and various other fraud-related counts.

The investigation into the full extent of Smith's illegal activities and the amount of funds embezzled is still ongoing. Bank officials are working to identify all compromised accounts and fraudulent transactions.

Investigative officers suspect this may have been an ongoing scheme by Smith spanning several months based on an initial review of financial records...
