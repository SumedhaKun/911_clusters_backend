POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case #: 2023-04517
Crime: Arson

On the night of May 12th, 2023, the Centerville Fire Department received a call around 11:45 PM reporting flames and smoke billowing from an abandoned textile mill on the outskirts of town. Upon arrival, firefighters encountered a raging inferno that had engulfed the entire east wing of the dilapidated three-story structure.  

After battling the blaze for several hours, investigators from the Arson Unit were called to the scene to determine the cause and origin of the fire. Evidence recovered from the charred ruins indicated a clear case of arson.

Witness statements described seeing a lone individual lurking around the property earlier that evening. Security footage from a neighboring business captured video of the suspect, dressed in dark clothing, forcing open a rear entrance to the mill using a prybar around 10:30 PM.

Once inside, the arsonist appears to have deliberately started multiple fires on the ground floor using matches and an accelerant, believed to be common gasoline based on the distinct odor reported by firefighters. The individual is then seen fleeing the area on foot shortly before the fires reached the point of accelerating on their own.

At this time, the suspect remains at large and the investigation is ongoing. Authorities are examining evidence recovered from the scene, including potential DNA samples, and following up on any leads provided by area witnesses and businesses.

The mill had been abandoned for over 15 years after the textile company went bankrupt. The property was slated for demolition next month to make way for a new apartment development. Damage estimates are not yet available, but the fire resulted in a total loss of the structure.

Anyone with information about this incident or the identity of the suspect is urged to contact the Centerville Police Department's tip line at 555-0199. All calls will be kept confidential.
