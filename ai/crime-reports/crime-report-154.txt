POLICE REPORT
Case #2023-04187

Nature of Incident: Fraud by Identity Theft

On April 12th, 2023, the victim (name withheld for privacy) reported being the target of identity theft and fraud. The victim stated that they first became aware of the issue when they received notifications from their bank about suspicious charges on their credit card accounts.

Upon investigating, the victim discovered that their personal information, including name, date of birth, social security number, and financial account details had been compromised and used to open several credit card accounts fraudulently in their name. 

The perpetrator(s) obtained the victim's personal data through unknown means, possibly via data breaches, phishing scams, or other illicit channels involving the trade of stolen personal information on dark web marketplaces.

Using the victim's stolen identity, the suspect(s) were able to bypass verification processes and open at least 5 credit card accounts across 3 major financial institutions. They then went on a spending spree, racking up over $75,000 in fraudulent charges for luxury goods, electronics, and travel expenses.

No force or weapons were used in the commission of this crime, as it was carried out remotely by exploiting vulnerabilities in identity verification systems.

Evidence collected so far includes credit card statements, documentation of the fraudulent accounts and charges, as well as a record of the victim's information being sold on the dark web.

The Financial Crimes Unit has been notified and is working closely with the banks and credit agencies involved to determine the source of the data breach and identify the perpetrator(s). The victim has been advised to freeze their credit and monitor their financial accounts closely.

This is an ongoing investigation. Anyone with information related to this case is urged to contact the Police Department immediately.
