Police Report #2023-04687

Crime: Murder 

On the night of April 16th, 2023, officers responded to a call of a disturbance at 225 Oak Tree Lane. Upon arrival, they discovered the body of 65-year-old John Henderson lying in a pool of blood in the kitchen. The victim had multiple stab wounds. 

The scene was processed and evidence collected, including a crowbar believed to have been used to pry open the back door for entry into the home. Forced entry marks were visible on the door frame.

Witness statements from neighbors indicated they heard loud banging noises around 11pm, followed by screams from inside the house. One neighbor's security camera captured footage of a tall, slender figure dressed in dark clothing entering the backyard around that time.

The murder weapon, a large kitchen knife belonging to the victim, was recovered near the body. The knife had Henderson's fingerprints as well as an as-yet unidentified second set of prints. Bloodstains and smear patterns indicate a violent physical struggle took place.  

The victim was home alone at the time. His wife Martha was out of town visiting family. There was no sign of forced entry into the home other than the pried back door. Valuables were undisturbed, suggesting robbery was likely not the primary motive.

The body has been transported to the medical examiner's office for an autopsy. The investigation is still ongoing. Police are canvassing the neighborhood for any other potential witnesses or surveillance footage.

Anyone with information about this incident is urged to call the anonymous tip line. A reward is being offered for information leading to the identification and arrest of the perpetrator.
