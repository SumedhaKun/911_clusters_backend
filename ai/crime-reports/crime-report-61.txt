POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case #2023-04611

Nature of Incident: Armed Robbery 

Date/Time: April 17, 2023 / 2:15 AM

Location: 125 Chestnut Lane, Oakwood City, VA 

On April 17th at approximately 2:15 AM, officers responded to a reported armed robbery at the residence of John and Mary Wilkins. Upon arrival, officers found the back door had been forcibly entered by picking the lock with what appeared to be a professional lockpicking kit.

The victims, John (age 67) and Mary (age 63) Wilkins, were at home sleeping when they were awoken by a loud noise coming from the kitchen. Mr. Wilkins went to investigate and was confronted by two masked suspects, one wielding a handgun. 

The armed suspect pointed the gun at Mr. Wilkins and demanded money and valuables. When Mr. Wilkins was initially hesitant to comply, the other suspect punched him in the face, causing a laceration above his left eye. 

Fearing for their lives, the victims turned over their wallets containing $320 in cash, Mrs. Wilkins' diamond wedding ring valued at $5,000, and Mr. Wilkins' gold watch valued at $2,500. The suspects then fled the scene through the back door they had picked open earlier.

Descriptions of the suspects are as follows:
- Suspect #1 (armed): Male, approximately 6 feet tall, medium build, wearing a black ski mask, dark clothing.
- Suspect #2: Male, approximately 5'8", stocky build, wearing a blue bandana over face, gray hooded sweatshirt.  

Forensics was called to the scene and lifted several fingerprints from areas the suspects likely touched. The lockpicking kit was collected as evidence. The suspects are still at large and an investigation is ongoing. Neighbors are being interviewed and residential security footage is being reviewed.
