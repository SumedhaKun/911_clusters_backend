POLICE INCIDENT REPORT

Case No: 2023-04185

Crime Type: Breaking and Entering, Burglary 

On April 12th, 2023 at approximately 2:30 AM, officers responded to a residential burglary in progress at 215 Oak Tree Lane. The homeowners, John and Jane Smith, awoke to loud noises coming from the first floor of their home. 

Upon arrival, officers discovered signs of forced entry through a rear kitchen window. The window had been pried open using a crowbar (common tool used to access secure locations). No weapons were located at the scene (weapons used: none).

Further investigation revealed that the perpetrators gained access to the home by picking the lock on the back door using a lock pick set (modes of accessing a victim). Once inside, the burglars rifled through the home, stealing a flat screen TV, jewelry, and approximately $3,000 in cash.

Interviewed neighbors reported seeing two suspicious individuals dressed in dark clothing loitering in the area earlier that evening. No other descriptors were provided.  

Evidence collected at the scene included numerous fingerprints, footprints, and DNA samples. The crime scene has been processed by forensics and all evidence is being analyzed.

The homeowners were unharmed during the incident, however they were understandably shaken up (type of force: none).

The investigation is ongoing. Anyone with information about this crime is urged to contact the police department's tip line. A $5,000 reward is being offered for any information leading to the identification and arrest of the perpetrators.
