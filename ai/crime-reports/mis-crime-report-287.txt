Details of the Incident:
On the night of July 17th, 2023, the Richards family of 125 Oak Tree Lane reported a home invasion robbery. Mr. and Mrs. Richards, along with their two children ages 8 and 12, were asleep when a lone intruder entered through an unsecured window.

The intruder, described as a Caucasian male approximately 5'10" with a slim build, made his way upstairs and into the master bedroom. He turned on the light and aimed the handgun at the parents, ordering them not to make any sudden movements.  

The intruder demanded cash, jewelry, and other valuables while keeping the gun trained on the victims. Mrs. Richards handed over her purse containing $120 in cash and her wedding rings. Mr. Richards retrieved a lockbox from the closet containing jewelry, watches, and savings bonds worth an estimated $7,500.

After collecting the valuables, the intruder bound the victims' hands with shoestrings and fled the scene. The Richards family was able to free themselves and contact the police around 3:45 AM.

Forensics teams processed the scene and collected fingerprints from the window used to access the home. The investigation is ongoing as authorities search for the perpetrator. Residents are advised to keep all windows, doors, and entry points properly secured.
