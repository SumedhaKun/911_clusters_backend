POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case #2023-047821

Crime Type: Fraud, Embezzlement, Theft by Deception 

On May 12th, 2023, the Financial Crimes Unit received a complaint from VastTech Corp regarding suspicions of employee misappropriation of company funds. An internal audit had uncovered significant discrepancies in accounting records and unexplained cash withdrawals over the past 18 months totaling over $3.2 million. 

The investigation identified the prime suspect as Martin Weller, a senior accountant who had worked at VastTech for 7 years. Weller had exclusive access to corporate financial systems and accounting software used to process payments, transfer funds, and conduct bookkeeping activities.

Forensic auditors meticulously reconstructed Weller's digital trail of fraudulent transactions dating back to November 2021. The modes of access exploited included:

- Misuse of accounting privileges to initiate unauthorized wire transfers from VastTech accounts to off-shore accounts under Weller's control
- Creation of shell vendor companies and generation of falsified invoices to siphon payments to personal accounts  
- Direct cash withdrawals from VastTech's operating accounts by manipulating accounting entries and doctoring records

To maintain his unchecked access, Weller employed common tactics such as:

- Exploitation of security vulnerabilities in outdated corporate accounting software
- Theft of colleague credentials through phishing/keylogging to increase his level of system access
- Planting of remote access tools (RATs) on accounting department workstations

No evidence of physical force or weapons was involved, as the crimes were committed purely through cyber means and abuse of legitimate system access. However, Weller did exert non-violent extortion against a junior accountant who grew suspicious of the irregularities, threatening financial ruin unless they remained silent.

The fraudulently obtained funds were laundered through an intricate web of shell companies and cryptocurrency transactions to cover Weller's trail. Assets seized thus far include 3 luxury vehicles, a vacation home in the Bahamas, and $1.8M in a Swiss bank account.

Martin Weller was arrested at his residence on May 14th and is currently in custody awaiting trial for charges including fraud, embezzlement, money laundering, and computer crimes. The investigation is still ongoing to identify potential accomplices and recover the remaining stolen funds.
