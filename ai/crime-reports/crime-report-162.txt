John Doe, 32 years old

On the evening of April 17th, the victim, John Doe, was taking his usual jog through Franklin Park when the incident occurred. According to witnesses, a black van with tinted windows pulled up alongside Mr. Doe. Two masked individuals exited the van and forcibly grabbed the victim, subduing him with physical force. 

The perpetrators bound Mr. Doe's hands behind his back with rope and his mouth was covered with duct tape to prevent him from calling out. The victim was then shoved into the rear of the van before the vehicle sped off out of the park area.

No weapons were seen or indicated in the commission of this crime, however the two assailants demonstrated a clear use of physical force and restraints to carry out the kidnapping. The van was last seen heading east on Main Street.

The motive behind the kidnapping is unknown at this time. No ransom demands have been received as of this report. The victim's family has been notified.
