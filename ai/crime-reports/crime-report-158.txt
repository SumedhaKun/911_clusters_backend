POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case #: 2023-04618
Date: April 12, 2023
Crime: Pickpocketing

On April 12th at approximately 3:15 PM, officers responded to a call regarding a pickpocketing incident at the downtown metro station. The victim, Jane Doe, reported that her wallet had been stolen while she was boarding a train during the late afternoon rush hour. 

According to Ms. Doe's statement, she was standing on the crowded platform waiting for the next inbound train. The area was extremely congested with commuters and travelers all attempting to board. As the train arrived, Ms. Doe was jostled by the surging crowd and felt someone bump into her from behind. At the time, she didn't think much of the contact due to the cramped quarters.

However, once Ms. Doe had boarded the train and found a seat, she went to retrieve her metro pass from her purse and realized her entire wallet was missing. Her purse showed no signs of tampering or forced entry. Ms. Doe believes that during the commotion of boarding, a skilled pickpocket used distraction and sleight of hand to deftly remove her wallet without her noticing.

No suspect has been identified at this time. Security footage from the station platform is being reviewed for any evidence that could lead to an arrest. The stolen wallet contained Ms. Doe's identification, bank cards, and approximately $75 in cash.

This case has been flagged as a non-violent larceny incident involving an skilled pickpocket who appears to have acted alone. No weapons or tools were used to gain access to the victim's belongings. The thief relied solely on crowded conditions and distraction techniques to commit the crime.

The investigation is ongoing. Anyone with any information regarding this incident is urged to contact the police department's tip line.
