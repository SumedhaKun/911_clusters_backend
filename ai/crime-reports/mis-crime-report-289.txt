POLICE INCIDENT REPORT 
Case #2023-04178

Crime Type: Armed Robbery  
Date/Time: April 12, 2023 / 2:15 AM
Location: 215 Main Street, Oakwood

On the morning of April 12th at approximately 2:15 AM, officers responded to a panic alarm at the First National Bank of Oakwood located at 215 Main Street. Upon arrival, officers found signs of a forced entry through the rear loading dock area. 

Modes of Accessing Victim:
Evidence at the scene indicates the perpetrators gained access to the bank by cutting through the lock on the loading dock bay door using a portable angle grinder. Common pry tools were also likely utilized to force open the interior door leading into the bank vault area once inside.

Common Tools Used to Access Secure Locations:
Tool marks on the loading dock door frame are consistent with the use of a battery-powered angle grinder to cut through the lock hasp. Pry bars and a sledgehammer were then seemingly employed to breach the vault room door itself.

Type of Force Used:
Overwhelming physical force appears to have been used to access the secure areas of the bank. Both the loading bay door lock and interior vault door show significant damage from forcible attack using power tools and prying implements.

Weapons Used in the Crime:
Per witness statements from the two bank employees who were on duty, the four suspects were all armed with semi-automatic handguns described as 9mm pistols. The weapons were used to subdue the employees and force compliance while the suspects accessed the vault and stole an undetermined amount of cash.

Crime Scene Details:
The vault area was found ransacked, with deposit boxes strewn about and a trail of scattered cash leading back out through the loading bay area where the suspects are believed to have escaped. Bullet casings were recovered indicating at least one shot was fired inside the bank, though no injuries were reported. 

Evidence Response:
Detectives and crime scene technicians have processed the scene for fingerprints, DNA, and additional physical evidence. The angle grinder, pry tools, and a sledgehammer were recovered and will be processed accordingly. Security camera footage is also being reviewed to attempt to identify the suspects.

The suspects remain at large and an extensive investigation is ongoing. Anyone with information is urged to contact the Oakwood Police Department immediately.
