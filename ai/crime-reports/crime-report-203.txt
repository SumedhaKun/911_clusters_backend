POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case #: 2023-04718

Date/Time of Incident: April 12, 2023 / 2:37 AM 

Location: 125 Main Street, Oakwood City, NY

Type of Crime: Robbery

Summary of Incident:
On the morning of April 12th, officers responded to a call reporting a robbery in progress at the Oakwood City Bank on Main Street. Upon arrival, officers encountered a chaotic scene. 

The suspects, three males estimated to be in their late 20s to early 30s, had gained entry to the bank's vault by using hand tools such as crowbars and sledgehammers to forcibly break through the vault's lock. Once inside, they threatened bank employees at gunpoint and demanded access to the safety deposit boxes. 

Multiple witnesses reported seeing the suspects violently shove employees to the ground and pistol whip a bank manager who initially refused to cooperate. The suspects were described as being extremely aggressive and unrestrained in their use of physical force against anyone who did not immediately comply with their demands.

After approximately 15 minutes, the suspects were able to access several safety deposit boxes and stuff an undisclosed amount of cash, jewelry and other valuables into duffle bags they had brought. They then fled the scene on foot, firing several shots from their semi-automatic handguns to deter any civilians from giving chase.

No civilians were injured during the incident, though three bank employees were treated for minor injuries sustained from being struck or shoved by the suspects. A county-wide manhunt is currently underway as police investigate any available leads on potential suspects.

Det. J. Callahan
