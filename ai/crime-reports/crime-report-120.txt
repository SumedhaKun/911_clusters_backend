Details of the Incident:

On the morning of April 21st at approximately 2:17 AM, the Centertown Police Department received a panic alarm from the First Community Bank on Oak Street. Officers arrived on the scene within three minutes to find the bank's front doors had been forcibly breached. 

Upon entering, they discovered three masked suspects still inside the bank lobby, armed with semi-automatic handguns. The suspects were in the process of emptying the vault of its cash deposits using crowbars and other hand tools to break the vault's lock mechanism.

When confronted by police, the suspects immediately opened fire, triggering a violent exchange of gunfire. Two of the suspects were struck by return fire from officers and incapacitated. The third suspect managed to flee out a rear exit while using a bank employee as a human shield.

The two incapacitated suspects were arrested and the stolen cash recovered from the scene. They have been identified as:

John Baker, 32
Michael Davis, 28

Both have extensive criminal records related to armed robbery and are known members of the North Side gang.

The third suspect remains at large and is described as a male, approximately 6 feet tall, wearing a black ski mask, dark clothing and was last seen fleeing on foot westbound from the bank's rear parking lot. 

A BOLO (Be On the Lookout) advisory has been issued for this armed and dangerous suspect. The bank employee taken as a human shield was not physically injured.

Evidence collected at the scene indicates this was a meticulously planned and prepared bank robbery by an experienced crew. Substantial charges related to armed robbery, kidnapping, assault on police and other felonies are pending against the suspects.

The investigation is ongoing. Anyone with information about this incident is urged to contact the Centertown Police Department immediately.
