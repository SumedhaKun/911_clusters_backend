POLICE REPORT
Case Number: 2023-0418-IT 

Crime: Insider Trading

Date of Incident: April 1, 2023

Location: Multiple financial institutions in New York City

Victim(s): Various investment firms and brokerage houses

Summary of Incident:
This case involves a sophisticated insider trading scheme that took place over several months across multiple financial firms in New York City. The suspect, John Doe, a former senior analyst at the investment bank Sycamore Capital, is alleged to have used confidential information from his former employer to illegally trade securities and reap millions of dollars in profits.

Doe is suspected of accessing and exploiting insider knowledge about pending corporate deals, earnings reports, and other market-moving events at companies where Sycamore Capital had clients or was conducting due diligence. Using this non-public information, Doe traded stocks, options, and other securities based on how the share prices would move once the confidential data became public.

The illegal trades are believed to have taken place between October 2022 and March 2023, generating an estimated $5.2 million in illicit profits for Doe. The SEC and federal prosecutors allege that Doe made trades through several brokerage accounts under his control as well as accounts belonging to family members to conceal his illegal activities.

No violence or weapons were used in the commission of this crime. However, Doe's unauthorized use and distribution of corporate secrets caused significant harm to the financial markets and investor confidence.

Evidence seized includes computers, trading records, encrypted communication devices, and bank records that detail the money trail. Doe could face decades in prison and millions in fines if convicted on charges of securities fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering.

This report has been prepared by Detective John Smith, badge #4522, of the Financial Crimes Unit of the New York City Police Department. The investigation is ongoing and additional charges may be forthcoming.
