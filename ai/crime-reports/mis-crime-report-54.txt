POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case No: 2023-14892

Crime Type: Identity Theft, Impersonation  

On May 3rd, 2023, at approximately 10:30 AM, officers responded to a call from First National Bank regarding a suspected fraud incident. Upon arrival, bank manager Karen Willis reported that an unknown individual had illegally accessed the accounts of two customers and withdrawn large sums of money.

Through the bank's security footage, officers were able to determine that the suspect had gained entry by impersonating a bank employee. The suspect, described as a male in his late 30s, was seen wearing a custom-made bank uniform with the First National Bank logo and carrying a fake employee ID badge. 

Once inside the bank, the suspect was able to bypass security protocols by utilizing commonly used social engineering tactics to manipulate employees into believing he was a new transfer from the regional headquarters. He claimed to be running routine software updates which allowed him to access the bank's customer database.

After obtaining the personal information of customers John Roberts and Emily Davidson through identity theft, the suspect was able to answer all security questions and gain full access to their accounts. He then initiated multiple large wire transfers totaling over $375,000 from their accounts to an offshore account.

Forensic analysis is ongoing to determine how the suspect obtained the victims' personal data, though it is suspected that he either purchased it from the dark web or was involved in a previous data breach incident.  

Common tools used by the suspect may have included devices for clandestinely copying data and blank ID badge printers to forge credentials. Type of force used was non-violent deception through impersonation and manipulation.

No weapons were reported as being used in the commission of this crime. The suspect remains at large and a state-wide alert has been issued. Anyone with information is urged to contact the police immediately.
