POLICE REPORT
Case #: 2023-0418-BG
Date of Incident: April 18, 2023
Type of Crime: Burglary

On the evening of April 18th, 2023, officers responded to a call reporting a residential burglary at 215 Oak Street. Upon arrival, the officers found the front window of the home had been broken, with shards of glass scattered on the ground outside.

The homeowners, John and Jane Doe, stated that they had returned home around 8 PM to find their front window smashed and the interior of their home ransacked. Multiple rooms had been rummaged through, with drawers and closets left open.

According to the homeowners, several valuable items were stolen, including:
- A 55" flat screen television 
- An Apple MacBook Pro laptop
- Mrs. Doe's jewelry box containing various pieces of jewelry 
- Around $300 in cash from Mr. Doe's wallet

During the initial investigation, officers recovered a crowbar near the broken window that is believed to have been used by the perpetrator(s) to gain entry into the home. Forensics teams collected fingerprint samples and other potential evidence from the crowbar and surrounding area.

Neighbors reported seeing a suspicious van parked on the street earlier that evening but were unable to provide a detailed description or license plate number. One neighbor mentioned hearing loud banging noises coming from the residence around 6:45 PM.

Based on the evidence collected, it appears that the unknown perpetrator(s) used brute force by smashing the front window with the crowbar to illegally gain entry. Once inside, the suspect(s) acted with disregard for property, tossing belongings and thoroughly searching for valuable items to steal.

No suspects have been apprehended at this time. The investigation remains ongoing as officers continue to follow up on leads and process any available evidence. Anyone with information regarding this incident is urged to contact the police department's tip line.
