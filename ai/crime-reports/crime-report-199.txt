Date/Time of Incident: July 18, 2022 - 11:45 PM  
Location: 200 Block of Main Street, Centerville

INCIDENT DETAILS:

On the evening of July 18th, officers responded to a report of an armed robbery at the First Capital Bank branch on Main Street. Upon arrival, officers interviewed the bank security guard, John Stevens, who stated that two masked men had pulled up in what appeared to be a stolen dark blue sedan. 

The suspects, dressed in black clothing and ski masks, exited the vehicle brandishing semi-automatic handguns. One suspect approached Mr. Stevens and struck him in the head with the butt of his gun, rendering him unconscious. 

The suspects then entered the bank, firing several shots into the ceiling to intimidate the staff and customers. They demanded that the bank tellers fill bags with cash from the vault. Fearing for their lives, the tellers complied.

After obtaining an undisclosed amount of cash, the suspects fled the scene in the stolen vehicle. Officers immediately launched an area search but were unable to locate the suspects or vehicle. 

Evidence collected at the scene included several spent 9mm casings and blood samples from Mr. Stevens' head injury. Security footage showed the two armed suspects entering and robbing the bank.

The suspects are described as two males, both approximately 5'10" to 6' tall with slender builds. They were last seen wearing black ski masks, pants, and hooded sweatshirts.

This violent takeover-style robbery is believed to be the work of the same suspects responsible for several other recent bank robberies in the region using similar modes of operation.

The investigation is ongoing. Anyone with information is urged to contact the Centerville Police Department's Robbery Division at 555-0176.
