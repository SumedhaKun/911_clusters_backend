INCIDENT REPORT
Case #: 2023-04159
Offense: Burglary 
Location: 123 Main St, Apartment 2B, Centerville 

SUMMARY OF INCIDENT:
On the morning of April 15th, 2023, officers responded to a call reporting a residential burglary at the apartment of Mrs. Jane Doe, 123 Main St, Apartment 2B. Upon arrival, officers found signs of forced entry through the front door of the apartment.

Mrs. Doe stated that when she woke up at approximately 7:00am to get ready for work, she immediately noticed her apartment had been ransacked. Multiple rooms were in disarray with furniture overturned, drawers emptied out, and belongings strewn about. She then discovered that her flat screen TV, laptop, jewelry box, and a locked safe containing valuables had been stolen.

EVIDENCE:
The front door's deadbolt lock showed clear signs of being picked, with deep scoring marks around the keyhole. Toolmark impressions on the door frame indicate a flat bar or crowbar was also likely used to pry the door open and defeat the lock.

Fingerprint analysis revealed multiple unknown prints on the door frame and surfaces throughout the apartment. Shoe prints and scuff marks were also recovered from the floors. Photographs and castings of the impressions were made as evidence.

No security cameras were present at the location. Canvassing the area did not yield any witnesses to the crime.

SUSPECTS: 
No suspects have been identified at this time. The investigation is ongoing to process evidence, canvass the neighborhood further, and identify any potential witnesses or leads.

NARRATIVE:
It appears that in the overnight hours between April 14th and 15th, an unknown perpetrator or perpetrators illegally entered the apartment of Mrs. Doe through forced entry by picking the front door lock and using a pry tool to physically force the door open.
