Police Report #2022-07183

Date of Incident: August 12th, 2022
Crime Type: Forgery 

On the evening of August 12th, the Central City Police Department received a call from First National Bank reporting suspected fraud. Upon arriving at the bank, officers interviewed the head teller, Janice Phillips.

Ms. Phillips stated that earlier that day, a well-dressed individual came into the bank to open a new account. The individual, who identified himself as Robert Williams, provided what appeared to be a valid driver's license and social security card. However, upon further inspection by the fraud department, these documents were determined to be high-quality forgeries.

Surveillance footage shows "Mr. Williams" entering the bank at approximately 10:15 AM carrying a briefcase. He went to one of the open teller stations and requested to open a new account, presenting the forged identification documents. After the account was opened, he immediately transferred $250,000 from an alleged outside account into the new one he had just established.

At 10:45 AM, "Mr. Williams" approached a different teller window, withdrew $20,000 cash from the new account, and promptly exited the bank. He was seen leaving the area in a late-model black BMW sedan with the license plate covered.

Forensic analysts were able to determine that the forged documents were printed using an advanced color copier/printer on high-quality paper and materials. The forgeries were extremely well-crafted and difficult to distinguish from authentic documents without specialized examination.

Based on the evidence, we believe an experienced forger was behind this crime. The suspect was able to create or obtain remarkably accurate fake identities using printers and other materials. No force or weapons were used during the commission of this non-violent fraud.

The Central City Police Department is reviewing additional surveillance footage and records to attempt to identify the suspect, believed to be operating under the alias "Robert Williams." Anyone with information regarding this incident is urged to contact the department immediately.
