POLICE INCIDENT REPORT

Case #: 2023-04159
Crime: Illegal Gambling Operation 

On April 15th, 2023 at approximately 11:30 PM, officers responded to an anonymous tip about suspected illegal gambling activities occurring at 216 Maple Street. Upon arrival, officers heard loud voices and noticed several vehicles parked outside the residence.  

Officers knocked and announced their presence. After no response, entry was made and officers discovered an illegal gambling den in operation. Approximately 15 individuals were present, participating in high-stakes poker games and sports betting over prohibited online gambling websites. 

Large amounts of cash and gambling paraphernalia such as playing cards, chips, and ledgers were collected as evidence. No weapons or signs of violence were found on the premises.

The main suspect, Joseph Marconi (age 42), was identified as the organizer and operator of the underground gambling ring. He utilized his residence as a secret, invite-only venue for gamblers to wager large sums of money on card games and sporting events.

Marconi gained entry for gamblers by personally vetting them and only allowing trusted individuals to participate and wager. No illegal tools or forced entry methods were used, as the gambling occurred privately on his personal property with the consent of those attending.

While being taken into custody, Marconi was cooperative with authorities. He now faces charges of operating an illegal gambling business, money laundering, and tax evasion among other offenses.

The investigation is ongoing as authorities work to identify all individuals involved and determine the full extent and history of this illegal gambling operation. Additional charges may be forthcoming.
