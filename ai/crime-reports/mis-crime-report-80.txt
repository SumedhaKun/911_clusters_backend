Summary of Incident:
On April 17th at approximately 2:20 AM, the Oakwood Heights Police Department received a frantic 911 call from the victim, John Smith. Smith reported that two unknown suspects had broken into his residence and threatened him at gunpoint before fleeing the scene with valuables. 

Upon police arrival, the victim was visibly shaken but unharmed. He stated that he was awoken by a loud noise coming from downstairs. As he went to investigate, he was confronted by two masked men dressed in dark clothing in his living room. 

The suspects gained entry by prying open a ground floor window using a crowbar. Once inside, they intimidated the victim into compliance by brandishing semi-automatic handguns and making verbal threats of violence if he did not cooperate.

While one suspect held the victim at gunpoint, the other proceeded to ransack the home, stealing a flat screen TV, laptop, jewelry, and approximately $3,000 in cash. The victim complied with their demands out of fear for his life.

After approximately 10 minutes, the suspects exited through the front door and fled in an unknown direction. The victim then immediately called 911. Police conducted a canvass of the neighborhood but were unable to locate the suspects.

Evidence collected at the scene included pry marks on the window frame, shoeprints, and fingerprints. The case has been assigned to Detective Karen Roberts for further investigation.

Suspects are described as:
#1 - Male, average height, medium build, dressed in dark clothing and a ski mask
#2 - Male, tall, muscular build, dressed in dark clothing and a ski mask
