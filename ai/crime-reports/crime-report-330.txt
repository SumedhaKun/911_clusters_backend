Location: 215 Oak Tree Lane, Oakwood

Victim(s): John and Jane Homeowner

On April 15th at approximately 2:37 AM, officers responded to a call of a residential burglary in progress at 215 Oak Tree Lane. Upon arrival, officers discovered signs of forced entry through a rear window of the home. 

The victims, John and Jane Homeowner, stated they were awoken by loud noises coming from the kitchen area. Mr. Homeowner went to investigate and encountered an intruder wearing a black ski mask and dark clothing. 

The suspect gained entry by using a lock pick set to bypass the window lock. No other common burglary tools like crowbars or lock picking tools were found at the scene. The mode of accessing the victims appeared to be an unlawful trespass with the intent to commit theft.

No weapons were brandished or located. However, the suspect used physical force to subdue Mr. Homeowner by pushing him to the ground and binding his hands with duct tape taken from the home. The suspect then rummaged through the home, stealing a laptop, jewelry, and cash before fleeing on foot out the back door.

Evidence collected at the scene included fingerprints from the window and duct tape residue. The suspect is still at large. Neighbors were canvassed for any witnessed suspicious activity.
