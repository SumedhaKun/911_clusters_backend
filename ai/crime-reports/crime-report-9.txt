Police Report #2022-078543
Crime: Burglary

On the night of April 17th, 2022, a home invasion and burglary occurred at 235 Oak Tree Lane. The homeowners, John and Jane Doe, reported that sometime between 11 PM and 2 AM, an unknown assailant(s) forcibly entered their residence. 

The perpetrator(s) gained entry by breaking the kitchen window on the side of the house with a crowbar. Glass shards were found on the ground outside, indicating moderate force was used to shatter the window and provide an entry point. Once inside, the burglar(s) made their way upstairs to the master bedroom.

Upon entering the bedroom, the intruder(s) encountered the homeowners, John and Jane Doe, who were awoken by the noise of the break-in. According to the victims' statements, the suspect(s) brandished a knife and demanded valuables while using threatening language. Fearing for their safety, the Doe's complied and handed over jewelry, cash, and other small valuables from their closet safe.

After obtaining an undisclosed amount of goods, the suspect(s) fled the scene on foot heading west on Oak Tree Lane towards Main Street. Neighbors did not report hearing or seeing any vehicles in the area. 

Evidence collected at the crime scene included:
- Shoeprints leading from the broken window to the bedroom
- Pry marks on the kitchen window frame from the crowbar 
- The crowbar itself, lying just outside the broken window
- Knife with a 6-inch blade, likely the one brandished, found in the bedroom

The Doe family was understandably shaken but did not sustain any physical injuries during the incident. The burglary and home invasion remain under investigation as authorities work to identify the suspect(s) involved. Anyone with information is urged to contact the police department's tip line.
