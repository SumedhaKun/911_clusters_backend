POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case #2023-04187

Date/Time of Incident: April 12, 2023 - 10:32 PM  
Location: 428 Main St, Oakwood City, VA 

Offense: Armed Robbery

Summary of Incident:
On the evening of April 12th, a brazen armed robbery took place at Joe's Convenience Store located at 428 Main Street. At approximately 10:30 PM, two masked suspects forcibly entered the premises through the front entrance while brandishing handguns.

The suspects, described as two males in their mid-20s, were wearing dark clothing and black ski masks that concealed their faces. One suspect, standing around 6 feet tall with an athletic build, held a black semi-automatic handgun pointed at the store clerk, while his accomplice, slightly shorter at around 5'9", guarded the entrance with a silver revolver in hand.

Upon entering, the taller suspect shouted "This is a robbery! Fill the bag and nobody gets hurt!" while aggressively waving his firearm. The store clerk, visibly shaken, complied and placed an undisclosed amount of cash from the register into a black duffel bag provided by the robbers.

After obtaining the money, the suspects swiftly exited through the front entrance and fled on foot eastbound on Main Street. No shots were fired and there were no reported injuries.

Evidence Recovered: 
- Black duffel bag 
- Surveillance footage from the store's security cameras

Witness Statements:
The store clerk described being in fear for his life when the armed suspects entered and pointed their guns directly at him while demanding the money from the cash register.

A customer who had just left the store seconds before the incident occurred reported seeing two masked individuals running eastbound on Main Street carrying a duffel bag, but did not witness the actual robbery.

No other witnesses have come forward at this time. The investigation is ongoing as law enforcement attempts to identify the suspects involved in this armed robbery incident.
