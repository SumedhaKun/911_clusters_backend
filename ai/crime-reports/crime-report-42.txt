On April 16th at approximately 2:15 AM, officers responded to a reported burglary in progress at 125 Oak Tree Lane in the suburban Oakwood neighborhood. Upon arrival, they found the homeowner, John Roberts (32), restrained and shaken but unharmed.  

According to Roberts' statement, he was awoken around 2 AM by the sound of shattering glass coming from the kitchen area. He went to investigate and was confronted by two masked intruders who had gained entry by breaking a window with a crowbar.

Fearing for his life, Roberts complied with their demands and told them where the home safe and jewelry boxes were located. The suspects then proceeded to ransack the home, taking an estimated $25,000 in cash, jewelry, and other valuables before fleeing the scene.

Evidence collected at the scene includes:
- Pry marks and a broken window in the kitchen area

The investigation is ongoing as officers canvass the neighborhood for any witnesses or surveillance footage that may aid in identifying the suspects. Residents are urged to keep doors and windows secured, and to report any suspicious activity immediately.
