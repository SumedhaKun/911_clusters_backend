Date/Time of Incident: April 12, 2023 / 23:47 hours

Location of Incident: The 300 block of Pine Street in downtown area.

Victim:
John Smith, male, age 32
321 Oak Street, Apt 4B 
Metropolis 

Summary of Incident:
On the evening of April 12th, the victim was ambushed and assaulted while walking home from his job at a restaurant in the downtown area. The victim stated he was taking a shortcut through a dimly lit alley in the 300 block of Pine Street when an unknown male subject approached him from behind without warning.  

The subject did not use any tools to access the location, instead lying in wait in the alley to ambush the victim. Once behind the victim, the subject began a brutal physical beating, striking the victim repeatedly with his fists. The victim sustained numerous contusions and lacerations to his face and upper body from the assault. 

The victim was unable to get a good look at his attacker due to the poor lighting conditions and the surprise nature of the attack from behind. He described the subject as a male approximately 6' tall with a medium build, wearing dark clothing. No weapons other than the subject's fists were used in the assault.

The victim's wallet containing $85 in cash and personal credit cards was taken during the incident, leading investigators to believe the motive was robbery. The victim was transported to Mercy Hospital for treatment of his injuries. 

Evidence Collected at Scene:
- Samples of suspected bloodstains
- Shoe impressions from subject
- Possible trace evidence including hair/fibers

The investigation is ongoing at this time as police search for any potential witnesses and review any available surveillance footage from the area. Anyone with information is urged to contact the Metropolis Police Department's tip line.
