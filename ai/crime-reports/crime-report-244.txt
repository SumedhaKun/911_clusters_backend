POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case #: 2023-47895

Date/Time: April 12, 2023 / 2:15 AM  

Location: International border crossing near Laredo, Texas

Incident Type: Drug Trafficking

Suspect(s): 
- Jose Gonzalez, male, 32 years old, American citizen
- Miguel Ramos, male, 28 years old, Mexican citizen  

Summary of Incident:
On the night of April 12th, Border Patrol agents observed two individuals behaving suspiciously near the Rio Grande river border crossing into the United States from Mexico. The two suspects, later identified as Jose Gonzalez and Miguel Ramos, were seen carrying large duffle bags across the shallow river from the Mexican side.

Agents maintained surveillance and witnessed the suspects load the duffle bags into a waiting pickup truck on the U.S. side. When agents attempted to initiate a traffic stop, the suspects fled at high speed, leading authorities on a 15-mile chase through rural farm roads. The suspects eventually stopped and attempted to flee on foot but were apprehended after a brief pursuit. 

Upon searching the duffle bags, agents discovered they contained approximately 75 kilograms of cocaine divided into brick-shaped packages wrapped in plastic and duct tape. The street value of the seized narcotics is estimated at over $3 million. No weapons or other tools were found on the suspects or in their vehicle.

The two suspects were arrested and charged with drug trafficking, importation of illegal narcotics, and evading arrest. Jose Gonzalez and Miguel Ramos are believed to be low-level operatives working for a powerful Mexican drug cartel. An investigation is ongoing to identify higher-level members of the trafficking organization.

Evidence Seized:
- 75 kg cocaine, packaged for distribution 
- 2001 Ford F-150 pickup truck
