POLICE INCIDENT REPORT

Case Number: 2023-04611
Crime Type: Burglary
Date/Time: April 15, 2023 / 2:17 AM

Summary:
On the morning of April 15th, officers responded to a call reporting a break-in at the First Capital Bank on Main Street. Upon arrival, they discovered that the premises had been illegally accessed and the vault had been breached. 

Access Methods:
The perpetrators appeared to have utilized sophisticated lock-picking tools and techniques to bypass the exterior door locks without leaving any signs of forced entry. Once inside, they employed similar non-destructive methods to open the internal vault door.

Common Tools:
Evidence at the scene suggests that the following tools were likely used to gain access:
- Lock pick set (rake picks, hook picks, tension wrenches)
- Endoscope/borescope camera to view internal locking mechanisms
- Electrical lock bypass tools

No weapons were brandished or used in the commission of this crime.

Details:
The bank's security footage showed three individuals dressed in dark clothing and masks entering the lobby at approximately 2:05 AM. They moved swiftly and with an air of professionalism, quickly disabling the alarm system. 

One perpetrator stood watch at the entrance while the other two made their way to the vault room. Using their lock-picking expertise, they were able to bypass the high-security vault door lock within a matter of minutes without triggering any alerts.

Once inside the vault, the two individuals methodically emptied the contents of all safe deposit boxes into duffel bags they had brought. They worked efficiently, completing the robbery in under 30 minutes before exiting through the same entrance.

The total value of the stolen cash, jewelry, and other valuables is still being assessed but is estimated to be in the millions. No employees were present during the incident, and no civilians were harmed.

The investigation is ongoing as authorities review all available evidence and surveillance footage to identify the suspects. Authorities are asking anyone who may have witnessed any suspicious activity in the vicinity to come forward with information.
