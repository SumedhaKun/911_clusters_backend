POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case #: 2023-04718

Crime Type: Aggravated Burglary

On the night of May 3rd, 2023, at approximately 2:15 AM, a home invasion occurred at 415 Maple Lane. The victims, John and Jane Doe, were asleep when the suspects gained entry by breaking a window in the rear of the home using a crowbar.  

Modes of Accessing Victim: 
Once inside, the two male suspects, both dressed in dark clothing and ski masks, located the bedroom and violently awakened the victims by shining a bright flashlight in their faces. They used intimidation and physical violence to subdue the couple.

Type of Force Used:
Mr. Doe was struck in the face by one of the suspects, likely with a blunt object, resulting in a broken nose and lacerations. Mrs. Doe was forcibly restrained with zip ties after being shoved to the floor. Both victims were threatened at gunpoint.

Common Tools Used to Access Secure Locations:
In addition to the crowbar used to break the window, it appears that the suspects also had a lock pick set, as the interior doors showed signs of being tampered with using these tools.

Weapons Used in the Crime:  
The suspects were armed with semi-automatic handguns, which they used to threaten the victims into cooperating. They stole jewelry, electronics, and cash from the residence before fleeing the scene in what is believed to be a dark-colored sedan.

The victims were transported to Mercy General Hospital for treatment of their injuries. Evidence has been collected from the scene and the investigation is ongoing. Anyone with information about this crime is urged to contact the Police Department immediately.
