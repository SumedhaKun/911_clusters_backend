Details:
On April 18th at approximately 2:37 AM, a robbery occurred at Oakwood Jewelers located at 125 Main St. The owner, John Smith, was closing up the store alone after business hours when he was ambushed by what he describes as 3-4 males wearing ski masks. 

The suspects gained access to the secure store by shattering the reinforced front glass door using a sledgehammer. Once inside, they immediately accosted Mr. Smith at gunpoint and bound his hands behind his back with zip ties. 

The suspects, who were all carrying semi-automatic handguns, proceeded to smash open the display cases and empty out their contents into duffel bags they had brought. An estimated $350,000 worth of jewelry, cash, and other valuables were stolen during the heist.

After cleaning out the store, the suspects pistol-whipped Mr. Smith and fled out the shattered front door, leaving him dazed but alive. He was able to activate a silent alarm once they had left.

Forensic evidence recovered at the scene includes shattered glass, pry marks on display cases, a couple of stray hairs, and a blood sample suspected to be from one of the suspects who may have cut himself during the smash-and-grab.

The suspects remain at large and all neighboring jurisdictions have been notified. The investigation is ongoing as detectives review surveillance footage and attempt to identify the perpetrators.
