POLICE REPORT
Case No: 2023-04718
Crime: Armed Robbery

On the night of May 15th, 2023, a daring armed robbery took place at the First National Bank on Main Street in downtown Oakville. According to witness statements and security footage, the incident unfolded as follows:

At approximately 10:15 pm, a group of four masked individuals forced their way into the bank through the rear entrance. Utilizing sophisticated lock-picking tools and a compact thermal lance, they were able to bypass the bank's security systems with relative ease. 

Once inside, the suspects immediately located the vault area and took two bank employees hostage at gunpoint. The perpetrators were armed with semi-automatic pistols and what appeared to be a military-grade assault rifle.

Employing brutal force and threats of violence, the robbers coerced the hostages into opening the vault's time-locked door. Inside, they discovered a substantial amount of cash, jewels, and other valuables.

During the heist, one of the suspects pistol-whipped a security guard who attempted to intervene, leaving him with a severe laceration to the head. Another guard was struck with the butt of the assault rifle and temporarily incapacitated.

After emptying the vault of its contents, the robbers fled the scene in a black unmarked van waiting outside the rear alley. Witnesses reported hearing tires screeching as the van sped away.

The total value of the stolen cash and valuables is currently estimated at over $3 million. Investigators are poring over the security footage and any available evidence in hopes of identifying the suspects.

This daring and violent robbery has deeply shaken the community of Oakville. Police are urging anyone who may have information regarding this crime to come forward immediately.
