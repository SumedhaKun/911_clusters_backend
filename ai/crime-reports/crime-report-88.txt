Here is a detailed police report for the crime of insider trading based on the provided parameters:

POLICE INCIDENT REPORT

Case Number: 2023-0416-IT-001

Crime: Insider Trading  

Date/Time of Incident: April 16th, 2023 at approximately 10:00 AM 

Location: Offices of Smith & Co Investment Firm, 123 Wall Street, New York City

Victim: The general public and any investors who bought or sold shares of PharmaTech Inc. based on non-public information.

Suspect(s): 
John Williams, age 47, Senior Vice President at Smith & Co
Mary Roberts, age 33, Corporate Lawyer at PharmaTech Inc.

Details of Incident:
On the morning of April 16th, the New York Stock Exchange was buzzing with suspicious trading activity around shares of the pharmaceutical company PharmaTech Inc. Millions of shares changed hands in a short period, sending the stock price soaring over 20%.

An investigation was immediately launched which uncovered evidence of illegal insider trading. John Williams, a high-ranking executive at Smith & Co Investment Firm, had been receiving confidential information about upcoming drug trial results from his mistress, Mary Roberts, a corporate lawyer at PharmaTech. 

Using this non-public information, Williams purchased millions of dollars worth of PharmaTech stock just days before the company announced that their experimental cancer drug had been approved by the FDA after highly successful clinical trials. The subsequent surge in the stock price allowed Williams to unlawfully profit by over $5 million from these trades.

No weapons or force were used in the commission of this crime. The mode of accessing the victim (the general investing public) was the unauthorized use and transfer of confidential corporate information related to the drug trial results by Roberts to Williams. The tool used was the inside information itself.

Both Williams and Roberts have been arrested and charged with multiple counts of securities fraud, insider trading, and racketeering. The ill-gotten gains from the illegal trades have been seized by federal authorities.
