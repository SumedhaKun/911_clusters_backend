POLICE INCIDENT REPORT

Case No: 2023-04717
Incident Type: Burglary
Date/Time Occurred: April 17, 2023 / Between 11:30 PM - 2:15 AM  
Location: 825 Oak Tree Lane, Oakwood

SUMMARY OF INCIDENT:

On the night of April 17th, 2023, a burglary occurred at the residence of John and Mary Smith at 825 Oak Tree Lane in the suburban neighborhood of Oakwood. The perpetrators gained entry through an unsecured second-floor window on the east side of the house. No forced entry was detected, suggesting the criminals may have utilized lock picking tools to bypass the window latch.

Once inside, the burglars methodically searched through each room, accessing secured areas like a walk-in closet and home office by picking the locks using a rake pick set and tension wrench commonly found in burglar tool kits. Valuables were selectively taken, including jewelry, electronics, and cash totaling an estimated $27,500 in losses.

Notably, the criminals did not resort to any weapons or physical force during the commission of this crime. Their entrance, movement, and exit appeared to have been carried out with a high degree of stealth and skill. However, they did leave behind some disturbing evidence...

EVIDENCE COLLECTED:
- Shoe prints (size 11) in the mud outside the east window 
- Fibers (blue cotton) collected from the window latch
- Hairs (Caucasian, blonde) found on the office desk chair
- Fingerprints (unknown) on the glass patio door handle
- Burglar tools (rake pick set and tension wrench) in the bushes

The investigation is still active and ongoing. Police are canvassing the neighborhood and following up on any leads. The public is urged to contact the Oakwood Police Department with any information regarding this incident or any suspicious activity observed in the Oak Tree Lane area that night.
