POLICE REPORT
Case No: 2023-04785

Crime: Robbery 

Date/Time: April 12, 2023 / 10:30 PM

Location: Intersection of Main St and 5th Ave

Victim: John Smith, 32-year-old male

On the evening of April 12th, the victim, John Smith, was walking home from work when he was approached by an unknown male suspect at the intersection of Main St and 5th Ave. 

The suspect confronted the victim on the street and demanded his wallet and cell phone at gunpoint. The suspect brandished a black semi-automatic handgun and threatened to shoot the victim if he did not comply. Fearing for his life, the victim handed over his belongings to the suspect.

After obtaining the victim's wallet containing $85 in cash and an iPhone 12, the suspect fled the scene on foot, heading westbound on Main St. The victim was not physically harmed during the incident.

The suspect is described as a Caucasian male, approximately 5'10" tall with a slim build. He was wearing a black hooded sweatshirt, blue jeans, and black sneakers at the time of the robbery. The suspect had his face partially covered with a black ski mask.

No vehicle was seen being used by the suspect. It appears the suspect may have been lying in wait and targeted the victim as he was walking alone at night in a relatively isolated area of the street crossing. 

The stolen items included the victim's brown leather wallet containing $85 cash, his driver's license, credit/debit cards and other identification, as well as an iPhone 12 in a red protective case.

Evidence collected at the scene included fingerprints lifted from the victim's belongings that were briefly handled by the suspect. Security camera footage from a nearby store is being reviewed to attempt to identify the suspect.

The investigation is ongoing. Anyone with information about this incident is urged to contact the police department's robbery unit at 555-0199.
