Location of Incident: Corner of Main St. and 5th Ave.

Victim: 
John Smith, 32-year-old male

Details of Incident:
On the evening of April 12th, the victim, John Smith, was walking home from his job at a downtown restaurant. As he turned the corner onto the dimly lit 5th Ave, he was approached by an unknown assailant. The suspect emerged from a shadowy alleyway, brandishing a handgun. He thrust the weapon towards Mr. Smith's abdomen and demanded in a gruff voice, "Give me your wallet and phone now, or I'll shoot!"

Fearing for his life, Mr. Smith complied and quickly surrendered his black leather wallet containing $85 in cash, his driver's license, and several credit cards. The suspect then ordered him to place his iPhone 13 on the ground as well. After collecting the victim's belongings, the armed robber backed away while still pointing the gun at Mr. Smith menacingly. He then turned and fled down the alleyway he had emerged from earlier.  

Mr. Smith immediately called 911 on a payphone once the suspect was out of sight. Police units responded to the scene within five minutes but were unable to locate the perpetrator after a search of the area.

The suspect is described as a male around 6 feet tall with an athletic build. He was wearing a black hooded sweatshirt, blue jeans, and white sneakers at the time of the robbery. His face was partially obscured by the hooded sweatshirt.
