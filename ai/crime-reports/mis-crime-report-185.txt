Summary of Incident:
On the morning of April 18th, the Oakwood Police Department received a frantic 911 call from the residents of 125 Oak Tree Lane reporting a home invasion and assault. Upon arrival, officers encountered an extremely chaotic scene.

The victims, John and Jane Smith, had severe injuries from being beaten with a baton. The front door showed clear signs of forced entry using a pry bar and other common burglary tools. 

According to the victims' statements, they were awoken around 2:15 AM by loud banging noises coming from the front of the house. Mr. Smith went to investigate and was immediately attacked by two masked intruders who forced their way inside. The suspects brutally struck Mr. Smith repeatedly with a baton, knocking him to the ground.

Mrs. Smith heard the commotion and confronted the intruders, who then assaulted her as well with the baton, causing lacerations to her head and arms. The suspects then began ransacking the home, seemingly looking for valuables. They ripped open drawers and overturned furniture.

At one point during the invasion, Mr. Smith attempted to reach for a firearm he legally owns, but one of the suspects threatened him with the baton. Fearing for their lives, the victims complied with the intruders' demands.

After approximately 25 minutes, the suspects fled the scene with an undisclosed amount of cash, jewelry, and electronics. Neighbors reported seeing two men wearing dark clothing and ski masks fleeing the area on foot.

Mr. and Mrs. Smith were transported to Oakwood General Hospital. Mr. Smith is listed in stable condition with a broken arm, while Mrs. Smith received emergency treatment for a severe concussion.

The Oakwood Police Department is requesting any information from the public regarding this violent home invasion. The suspects are considered armed and extremely dangerous. Call the tip line at 555-0192 if you have any details that could aid the investigation.
