Nature of Incident: Violent Crime - Home Invasion

On April 15th, 2023 at approximately 2:15 AM, officers responded to a 911 call reporting a home invasion in progress at 578 Oak Tree Lane. Upon arrival, officers encountered a chaotic scene.

The victims, John and Jane Doe, an elderly couple in their 70s, reported that they were awoken by a loud crashing sound coming from their front entrance. According to the victims, an unknown male suspect had kicked in their front door, splintering the door frame.

Once inside, the suspect brandished a large hunting knife and threatened the terrified residents. Wielding the blade menacingly, the suspect demanded valuables and cash. In fear for their lives, the Doe's complied and turned over jewelry, electronics, and their life savings totaling an estimated $25,000.

The suspect then physically assaulted Mr. Doe, striking him repeatedly with his fists and the butt of the knife. Mrs. Doe attempted to intervene but was violently shoved to the ground by the assailant. Both victims suffered lacerations, contusions, and suspected fractures requiring hospitalization.

After the vicious attack, the suspect fled the scene on foot with the stolen goods. Neighbors reported hearing shouting and a vehicle speeding away shortly after 2:20 AM, but no descriptions were obtained. 

Evidence collected at the scene included:
- Pry marks and a dusty boot print on the shattered front door
- Blood stains and smears throughout the residence
- The Doe's belongings strewn about after the ransacking

The suspect remains at large and is considered armed and extremely dangerous. He is described only as a male of unknown race, approximately 6 feet tall with a muscular build, last seen wearing a dark hooded sweatshirt, jeans, and work boots.

Residents are warned not to approach the suspect and to immediately contact 911 if he is spotted. The investigation is ongoing by the Violent Crimes Unit. Anyone with information is urged to call the anonymous tip line.
