POLICE REPORT

Case Number: 2023-0418-076

Crime Type: Identity Fraud, Robbery 

On April 18th, 2023, at approximately 9:15 PM, the victim, John Doe (34), was returning to his home at 215 Oak Street after work. As he approached his front door, two masked individuals ambushed him from behind. One suspect forcibly restrained Mr. Doe using zip ties while the other rummaged through his belongings, stealing his wallet, keys, and mobile phone. 

The suspects then forced their way into Mr. Doe's residence using the stolen keys. Once inside, they bound Mr. Doe's hands and feet and demanded access to his personal computer and online accounts. Utilizing false documents and digital manipulation, the perpetrators were able to bypass security measures and gain unauthorized access.

Over the course of several hours, the criminals methodically extracted sensitive personal and financial information from Mr. Doe's devices and online profiles. They also compelled him to provide passwords and security codes under duress, threatening physical harm with a semi-automatic handgun if he did not comply.

After obtaining the desired data, the suspects further robbed the premises, taking valuables such as jewelry, electronics, and cash. They then fled the scene, leaving Mr. Doe bound and injured from minor lacerations sustained during the assault and restraint.

Mr. Doe was eventually able to free himself and contact the authorities at approximately 1:30 AM on April 19th. Forensic technicians and investigators were dispatched to process the crime scene and collect potential evidence.

The two suspects remain at large and are considered armed and extremely dangerous. They are described as:

Suspect 1: Male, approximately 5'10" to 6' tall, medium build, dressed in dark clothing and a ski mask.

Suspect 2: Male, approximately 5'8" to 5'10" tall, athletic build, dressed in dark clothing and a balaclava.

Anyone with information regarding this case or the potential identities of the suspects is urged to contact the police department immediately.

This concludes the initial police report.
