POLICE REPORT 

Case Number: 2023-04-17B
Crime: Smuggling 
Date: April 17, 2023

On April 17th, 2023, Border Patrol agents conducted a routine inspection of a semi-truck at the San Ysidro border crossing into the United States from Mexico. The truck, driven by Juan Ramirez (34), was hauling what appeared to be a legal shipment of household furniture from a factory in Tijuana.

However, upon closer examination using X-ray scanners and a canine unit, agents discovered that several of the larger furniture items had been hollowed out and filled with plastic-wrapped bricks. Field tests confirmed these bricks contained cocaine with an estimated street value of $5 million.

Ramirez was immediately taken into custody. He admitted to knowingly transporting the narcotics shipment across the border for a payment of $20,000 from members of the Sinaloa Cartel operating in Tijuana. Ramirez had made several similar runs over the past six months using his commercial trucking credentials to avoid suspicion.

No weapons or other means of force were found or used during this smuggling operation. The cocaine shipment and truck were seized as evidence. Ramirez was charged with narcotics trafficking, smuggling across international borders, and conspiracy to distribute controlled substances.

The investigation is ongoing to identify other individuals involved in coordinating these smuggling activities. Homeland Security Investigations and the DEA have been brought in to assist.

This report has been prepared by Officer Michael Perez, Badge #27458 of the U.S. Border Patrol, San Diego Sector.
