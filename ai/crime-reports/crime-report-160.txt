POLICE REPORT
Case No. 2023-04857

Crime: Arson

Date/Time: April 12, 2023 / 2:17 AM

Location: 215 Oak Street, Apartment 3B, Centerville

Reported By: Thomas Wilson, building resident 

On the morning of April 12th at approximately 2:20 AM, the Centerville Fire Department responded to reports of smoke coming from 215 Oak Street, a multi-unit apartment building. Upon arrival, they discovered an active fire burning in Apartment 3B on the third floor. 

The fire was contained and extinguished, but not before causing significant damage to the unit and smoke damage throughout the hallway. The apartment's resident, 28-year-old Mark Jenkins, was not home at the time. No injuries were reported.

An initial investigation by arson investigators and the Crime Scene Unit determined the fire was intentionally set. Evidence shows an unknown perpetrator illegally entered the apartment building, likely using a copied key or lock picking tools. Once inside 3B, accelerants such as lighter fluid were used to ignite combustible materials.

Witness statements corroborate that a man matching Mr. Jenkins' description was seen leaving the area shortly before the fire alarm sounded. He has not been located or interviewed yet. The motive is unknown at this time, but a jealous romantic partner or disgruntled acquaintance cannot be ruled out.  

The arson investigation is ongoing. Anyone with information about this incident or the whereabouts of Mark Jenkins is urged to contact the Centerville Police Department's tip line immediately.

Investigating Officers:
Detective M. Rollins
Detective K. Booker
Arson Investigator R. Calley
