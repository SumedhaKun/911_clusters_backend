POLICE REPORT
Case No: 2023-0416-BUR
Crime Type: Burglary

On the night of April 16th, 2023, a residential burglary occurred at 215 Oak Street. The homeowners, John and Jane Doe, reported that upon returning home at approximately 11:30 PM, they discovered signs of a forced entry and valuables missing from their residence.

The primary point of entry appears to be a broken window on the ground floor at the rear of the home. Forensic analysis revealed pry marks around the window frame consistent with the use of a crowbar or similar tool. Shards of glass were found both inside and outside the window, indicating it was broken from the outside to gain access.

Once inside, the perpetrator(s) conducted an unlawful trespass and theft. The master bedroom appeared to be the main area disturbed, with drawers rummaged through and the contents strewn about. Specific items reported stolen include:

- Mrs. Doe's jewelry box containing various pieces of jewelry valued at approximately $8,000
- A locked fireproof safe that previously contained important documents, cash, and valuables (total value unknown)
- Mr. Doe's designer wristwatch valued at $5,000

Evidence suggests that physical force was utilized to remove the safe from its anchored location in the bedroom closet. Scuff marks and gouges in the hardwood floor indicate the safe was likely dragged across the floor before being carried out through the broken window.

No firearms or other weapons are known to have been used during the commission of this crime. However, the perpetrator(s) did employ brute force to gain entry and remove the heavy safe, suggesting a potentially violent demeanor.

Canvassing of the neighborhood is underway, and any residents with security footage or witness testimony are urged to contact the police department immediately. The investigation into this brazen residential burglary remains active and ongoing.
