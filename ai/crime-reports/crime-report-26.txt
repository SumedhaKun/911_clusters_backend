Victim: 
Jane Doe, 32-year-old female

Suspect(s):
Unknown, described as a Caucasian male, approximately 6 feet tall, medium build, wearing a black hoodie, blue jeans, and a baseball cap. 

Details:
On the evening of April 17th, the victim, Jane Doe, reported that she was abducted at gunpoint from her home located at 257 Oak Tree Lane in the suburban neighborhood of Oakwood. 

According to the victim's statement, she had just returned home from work around 10:15 PM and was exiting her vehicle in the driveway when the suspect approached her from behind. The suspect was wielding a black semiautomatic handgun and threatened to shoot Ms. Doe if she did not comply with his demands.

Under the threat of violence, the suspect forced the victim back into her vehicle, a blue 2019 Honda Civic, and ordered her to drive away from the residence. The suspect sat in the rear passenger seat and instructed the victim to head towards the interstate, keeping the handgun pointed at her during the entire incident.

After driving for approximately 45 minutes, the suspect had the victim pull over at a remote rest area just off the interstate. It was at this location that the suspect exited the vehicle and fled on foot, leaving the victim unharmed but visibly shaken.

The victim immediately reported the incident by calling 911 from her cell phone. Law enforcement officers responded and processed the vehicle for evidence. Relevant forensics teams were also dispatched to the crime scenes to gather additional evidence and investigate further.

The suspect remains at large, and all available units have been advised to be on the lookout for the individual matching the description provided by the victim. The motive behind this kidnapping is still unknown at this time.

The investigation is ongoing. Anyone with any information regarding this incident is urged to contact the Police Department immediately.
