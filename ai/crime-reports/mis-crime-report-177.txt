On April 18th at around 2:15 AM, officers responded to a 911 call reporting a home invasion in progress at 825 Maple Grove Lane. Upon arrival, officers found the front door had been forced open and cleared the residence. 

The victims, John and Jane Doe, stated that they were awoken by loud noises coming from the first floor. Mr. Doe went to investigate and was confronted by three masked intruders armed with semi-automatic handguns.

Modes of Accessing Victim:
The suspects gained entry by shattering the front window with a blunt object, likely a crowbar or sledgehammer. Once inside, they threatened the homeowners at gunpoint and demanded valuables.

Common Tools Used to Access Secured Locations:
Aside from the apparent use of a pry tool to breach the front door, the suspects were also found to be in possession of a lockpicking kit and small handheld power tools which could be used to compromise additional locking mechanisms.

Type of Force Used:
The suspects physically restrained both victims by binding their hands behind their backs with zip ties. Mr. Doe sustained a laceration to the head after being pistol whipped when he initially resisted the suspects' demands.

Weapons Used in the Crime:
The three suspects were armed with semi-automatic handguns described as compact 9mm pistols, possibly Glock 19 or similar models based on the victims' statements.

After clearing the residence, officers collected evidence including DNA samples, fingerprints, shoe impressions, and tool mark castings. The victims were treated by EMS for minor injuries.

The suspects fled the scene with an undisclosed amount of cash, jewelry, and electronics. They were last seen leaving in a dark colored SUV, possibly a Ford Explorer or Chevrolet Tahoe.

The investigation is ongoing and police are canvassing the area for any available surveillance footage that may assist in identifying the suspects. Anyone with information is urged to contact the Cityville Police Department immediately.
