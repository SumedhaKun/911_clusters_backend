Crime Type: Home Invasion and Aggravated Assault

On April 17th, 2023, at approximately 2:15 AM, officers responded to a 911 call reporting a violent home invasion at 123 Maple Street. Upon arrival, officers encountered a chaotic scene with clear signs of forced entry and a struggle.

The victims, John and Jane Doe, reported that they were awoken by loud noises coming from the first floor of their residence. As Mr. Doe went to investigate, he was immediately confronted by three masked intruders who had gained entry by breaking through a rear window.

Modes of Accessing the Victim:
The perpetrators employed various methods to access the victims, including physical force, intimidation, and the use of common tools to breach secure locations.

Common Tools Used to Access Secure Locations:
Evidence at the scene suggests that the intruders utilized a crowbar and a sledgehammer to force open the rear window, granting them access to the home. Additionally, duct tape and zip ties were found, indicating the suspects' intention to restrain the victims.

Type of Force Used: Physical Force
Once inside, the suspects violently assaulted Mr. Doe, using physical force to subdue him. Mrs. Doe, upon hearing the commotion, attempted to intervene but was also overpowered and restrained by the intruders.

Weapons Used in the Crime:
During the altercation, the suspects brandished various weapons, including a baseball bat and a hunting knife. Mr. Doe sustained severe lacerations and contusions consistent with being struck by the baseball bat, while Mrs. Doe reported being threatened with the hunting knife.

The suspects proceeded to ransack the residence, stealing various valuables, including jewelry, electronics, and cash. Before fleeing the scene, they further threatened the victims, warning them against contacting the authorities.

Despite their injuries, Mr. and Mrs. Doe managed to call 911 once the suspects had left, providing descriptions of the assailants and their vehicle, a dark-colored sedan.

Forensic teams have been dispatched to the scene to gather evidence, and a neighborhood canvass is underway to locate potential witnesses or surveillance footage that may aid in identifying the suspects.
