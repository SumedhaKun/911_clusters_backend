Crime: Homicide 

Date/Time: April 12, 2023 / 2:17 AM

Cause of Death: Multiple stab wounds

Summary:
On April 12th at approximately 2:17 AM, the Bloomington Police Department received a 911 call reporting screams coming from 375 Oak Ridge Lane. Officers arrived on scene at 2:26 AM and found the front door ajar. They entered and cleared the residence, locating the victim, later identified as John Simons, lying in a pool of blood in the upstairs master bedroom. 

The victim had sustained multiple stab wounds to the abdomen and chest area. He was unresponsive and showed no signs of life. EMS arrived and the victim was pronounced dead at the scene at 2:41 AM.  

Evidence at the scene indicates that the perpetrator(s) gained entry by throwing a large rock through a window on the first floor near the front door. The rock was found on the floor inside along with shards of broken glass. Forced entry marks were also present on the front door, indicating it may have been kicked in after the window was broken.

Once inside, the suspect(s) made their way upstairs where a violent struggle ensued in the master bedroom. Overturned furniture, blood spatter patterns, and deep gouges in the hardwood floor and walls are consistent with a physical altercation involving blunt force trauma and use of an edged weapon.

The murder weapon, a large kitchen knife, was located under the bed along with two billfolds belonging to the victim. At this time, robbery appears to be the primary motive.

No suspect(s) were apprehended at the scene and the investigation is ongoing. Forensics is processing evidence and canvassing the neighborhood for any witnesses or surveillance footage that may aid in identifying the perpetrator(s).
