POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case #2023-04718

Nature of Incident: Vandalism 

Date/Time of Incident: April 12, 2023 / 2:15 AM

Location: Downtown Business District, 125 Main Street

Summary of Incident:
On the morning of April 12th, officers responded to a call regarding vandalism at the office building located at 125 Main Street. Upon arrival, they discovered the front exterior walls and windows had been defaced with spray paint and marker graffiti. 

The perpetrators appeared to have gained access to the property by cutting through a chain link fence at the rear of the building. Footprints and tire tracks indicated at least three individuals were involved. Tools recovered at the scene included bolt cutters, likely used to cut the fence, as well as discarded cans of spray paint and permanent markers in various colors.

The graffiti itself consisted of incoherent scribbles, crude drawings, and illegible "tags" that may indicate gang involvement. Some of the markings appeared to target and disparage a local community organization located in the building. At this time, the motive seems to be random vandalism and defacement of property.

No suspects were apprehended at the scene. Evidence has been collected and processed for potential fingerprints and DNA. Building security footage is also being reviewed.

The property owner, Acme Properties LLC, has been notified and is cooperating with the investigation. They are assessing the costs of professional cleanup and repair of the damage.

This case has been forwarded to the department's Gang Crimes Unit for further investigation into potential gang associations. Additional patrol has been requested for the area to deter any further incidents.
