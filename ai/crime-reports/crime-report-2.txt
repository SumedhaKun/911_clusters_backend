POLICE REPORT
Case No: 2023-04281

Crime: Assault 

Date/Time of Incident: April 12, 2023 / 11:45 PM

Location: Rear alleyway behind Main St. Bar & Grill 

Summary of Events:
On the evening of April 12th, the victim, John Smith (28), was ambushed and violently assaulted while walking alone through a dimly lit alleyway. According to the victim's statement, he was exiting through the rear entrance of the Main St. Bar & Grill after having a couple drinks with friends. As he turned into the alley, he was suddenly grabbed from behind and thrown forcefully against the brick wall. 

The perpetrator, described as a male in his 30s, around 6 feet tall with a muscular build, then began raining blows down upon the victim using only his fists as weapons. Mr. Smith states he was struck repeatedly in the face and torso area. The brutal physical beating lasted approximately 2-3 minutes before the attacker fled the scene on foot after hearing voices approaching.

The victim was left battered and bloodied, suffering a broken nose, multiple facial contusions and lacerations, two cracked ribs, and a severely swollen jaw. He was transported to Mercy Hospital by ambulance for treatment.

No tools were utilized by the perpetrator to access the victim, who was ambushed and assaulted through physical force alone. The dark, isolated alleyway provided an ideal setting for the attack to be carried out without witnesses. 

Police canvassed the area but were unable to locate the perpetrator. The motive behind this vicious assault is unknown at this time. The investigation remains ongoing as authorities review any available surveillance footage and follow up on any potential leads.
