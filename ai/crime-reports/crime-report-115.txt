POLICE REPORT
Case No: 2023-07182

Date of Incident: April 21st, 2023
Location: 215 Oak Tree Lane

Nature of Crime: Violent Crime (Murder)

On the night of April 21st, 2023, a brutal home invasion and murder took place at 215 Oak Tree Lane. The victim, John Robbins (age 48), was found deceased in his living room by his wife, Mary Robbins, upon returning home from work around 7:30pm. 

The perpetrators appear to have gained entry by forcibly prying open a ground-floor window using a crowbar, causing significant damage. Rope was also found at the scene, suggesting the suspects may have scaled to an upper level of the home or potentially restrained the victim during the crime.

Evidence at the scene indicates a violent struggle ensued between the victim and assailant(s). Blunt force trauma consistent with strikes from a crowbar was present on Mr. Robbins' body. The fatal injury was a deep laceration to the victim's throat, likely inflicted by a knife that has not yet been recovered. 

Robbery does not appear to be the primary motive, as valuable items remained untouched throughout the home. The violence exhibited suggests this was a targeted, personal attack; however, no clear motive has been established at this time.

Canvassing of the neighborhood is underway, and any residents with security footage or who may have witnessed suspicious persons or vehicles in the area between 5pm and 8pm are urged to contact the police immediately.

The investigation remains open and active. Anyone with any information regarding this heinous crime is asked to call the tip line at 555-0198.
