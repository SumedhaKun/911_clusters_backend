On the evening of April 7th, 2023, the victim, John Smith (28), was walking home from his job at the local grocery store. As he reached the intersection of Main St. and Elm Ave., a suspect approached him from behind. 

The suspect, described as a Caucasian male in his mid-30s, approximately 6 feet tall with a slim build, pulled out a black semi-automatic handgun and pointed it directly at Mr. Smith. In a gruff voice, the suspect demanded, "Give me your wallet and phone right now, or I'll shoot!"
