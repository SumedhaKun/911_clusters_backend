Details of Incident:
On the evening of April 16th, the victim, Jane Doe, reported being the target of cyberbullying on various social media platforms. The suspect(s), whose identities are unknown, posted multiple threatening and derogatory messages directed at the victim.

The harassment began around 8:00 PM when the victim received an anonymous message on Instagram calling her derogatory names and making threats of physical violence if she did not comply with certain demands. Over the next few hours, similar messages continued across Jane's other social accounts including Snapchat, Twitter, and Facebook.

The messages were sent from what appears to be newly created, untraceable accounts. The messages contained explicit language, body shaming, and threats of releasing private information and photos if Jane did not send inappropriate videos and images as the suspect(s) demanded.  

Jane Doe stated she was in fear for her safety due to the aggressive and escalating nature of the threats. She blocked the accounts, but new ones continued to surface and bombard her with messages throughout the night until around 11:30 PM.

No financial demands or ransom requests were made. No weapons were used or mentioned during the cyberbullying incidents.

The incidents were carried out solely through threatening messages and emotional harassment posted on social media sites from a computer or phone by the unknown suspect(s).
