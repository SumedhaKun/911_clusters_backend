POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case #2023-04159

Nature of Incident: Fraud
Date/Time Reported: April 17, 2023 / 2:15 PM  
Location: 125 Main St, Oakwood, NY 

SUMMARY OF INCIDENT:
On April 17th, 2023 at approximately 2:00 PM, the victim, Margaret Wilkins (67), reported being the target of a fraud scheme. Ms. Wilkins received a phone call from an individual claiming to be a representative from the Social Security Administration. The suspect, using deceptive tactics, convinced Ms. Wilkins that her Social Security number had been compromised and involved in illicit activities. 

The suspect instructed Ms. Wilkins to withdraw $8,500 in cash from her bank account and provide the money to a "federal agent" who would be collecting it from her residence to investigate the fraud. At approximately 1:45 PM, a man arrived at Ms. Wilkins' home, dressed in a suit and carrying fake credentials identifying himself as "Agent Michael Thompson" from the SSA Fraud Department.

Ms. Wilkins handed over an envelope containing $8,500 in cash to the impersonator, who then promptly left the scene. After waiting a while with no further contact, Ms. Wilkins grew suspicious and contacted the real Social Security Administration, who informed her that she had been the victim of a fraud scheme known as the "Government Impersonator Scam."

SUSPECT DESCRIPTION:
The suspect who arrived at the victim's home was described as a white male, approximately 30-40 years old, 5'10" tall with a medium build. He had short brown hair and was wearing a black suit, white shirt, and red tie. No other distinguishing features were noted.

EVIDENCE RECOVERED:
No physical evidence was recovered from the scene. The incident appears to have been a scheme utilizing deception over the phone and by impersonating a government official, with no actual tools or weapons used to gain compliance.

INVESTIGATION ONGOING.
