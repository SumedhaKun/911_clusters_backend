INCIDENT REPORT
Case #2023-04687
Reporting Officer: Det. J. Thompson

INCIDENT DETAILS:
Type of Crime: Embezzlement
Date/Time of Incident: Between January 1, 2022 - March 31, 2023
Location: Acme Financial Corp, 123 Main St

SUMMARY:
This incident involves the suspected embezzlement of company funds over an extended period by a former employee, Jessica Roberts (DOB: 05/22/1985). Roberts had been employed as a Senior Accountant at Acme Financial Corp for 7 years before her termination on April 1, 2023.  

An internal audit revealed significant discrepancies and unauthorized transfers from the company's accounts into Roberts' personal banking accounts totaling over $325,000 during the period in question. 

Roberts is suspected of utilizing her accounting access privileges and knowledge of the company's financial systems to siphon funds gradually over time in an effort to avoid detection. Bank records indicate the stolen money was used for personal expenses including luxury purchases, vacations, and gambling.

INVESTIGATION:
Company IT has provided records confirming Roberts repeatedly accessed restricted financial accounts and conducted illegal transfers using her credentials from her company-issued computer and mobile devices. Credit card statements also revealed she used a company card repeatedly for personal charges and cash advances.

Interviews with colleagues suggested Roberts had developed a gambling addiction and was struggling with significant personal debt, providing a possible motive. However, she maintained an outwardly luxurious lifestyle inconsistent with her $95,000 salary.

CHARGES:
Based on the evidence obtained, Jessica Roberts will be charged with:
- Embezzlement 
- Theft 
- Computer Fraud
- Unauthorized Use of Access Device

Case Status: OPEN - Warrant issued for the arrest of Jessica Roberts. Extradition process initiated as her last known location was in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.
