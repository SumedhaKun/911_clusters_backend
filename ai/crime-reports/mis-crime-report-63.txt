POLICE REPORT
Case #: 2023-04612

Crime Type: Burglary 

On the night of April 15th, 2023, a residence located at 567 Maple Lane was broken into and burglarized. The homeowners, John and Jane Doe, reported that they had left their home around 7pm to go to a movie. Upon returning at approximately 10:30pm, they discovered signs of a forced entry and numerous valuables missing from the home.

The perpetrator(s) appeared to have gained access by picking the lock on a ground floor window at the rear of the home. Distinctive marks on the window frame indicate that a screwdriver was likely used as the tool to bypass the lock mechanism. 

Once inside, the burglar(s) ransacked several rooms, overturning furniture and stealing a large flatscreen TV, an expensive jewelry collection, and a portable safe containing important documents and cash. The total value of the stolen goods is estimated at over $25,000.

Evidence recovered at the scene suggests the intruder(s) may have escaped through the front door, as it was found ajar with the deadbolt disengaged from the inside. Scuff marks and partial shoe prints were discovered near the front entrance.

Forensics teams were called in to dust for fingerprints and collect any potential DNA evidence. Canvassing of the neighborhood is underway to identify any potential witnesses or home surveillance footage that may have captured the suspects.

The investigation is still active and ongoing. Any persons with knowledge of this incident or the possible identities of the perpetrator(s) are urged to contact the Police Department immediately.
