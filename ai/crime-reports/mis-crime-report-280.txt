On April 23rd, 2023 at approximately 2:15 AM, officers responded to a call regarding a break-in at the Uptown Gallery on Main Street. Upon arrival, officers discovered signs of forced entry through the rear entrance of the building.  

The crime scene investigation revealed that the perpetrator(s) gained access by breaking the door lock using common burglary tools such as a lock pick set and a pry bar. Once inside, the perpetrator(s) smashed several display cases and made off with an undisclosed amount of valuable artwork and jewelry.

Witness statements indicate that a dark colored van was seen speeding away from the area around the time of the incident. Forensic evidence collected at the scene, including bloodstains and hair samples, suggest that physical force was used against the night security guard who was found unconscious and badly beaten.

Wilson reported being ambushed from behind by an unknown assailant wielding a blunt metal object, believed to be a pipe or crowbar. The attack left Wilson with a severe concussion, multiple lacerations, and several broken ribs.

Detectives are following up on all leads and reviewing surveillance footage from nearby businesses. Any individuals with information regarding this incident are urged to contact the police department's tip line.
