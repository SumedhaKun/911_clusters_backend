INCIDENT DETAILS:
Type of Crime: Burglary 
Location: 415 Oak Tree Lane, Oakwood

On April 18th at approximately 2:15 AM, officers responded to a residential burglary in progress at 415 Oak Tree Lane. The homeowner, John Smith, called 911 after being awoken by loud noises coming from the first floor of his home.  

Upon arriving at the scene, officers found signs of forced entry through a rear window which had been pried open with a crowbar (recovered at the scene). Moderate force appeared to have been used to gain entry, damaging the window frame. 

Inside the home, officers encountered the suspect, later identified as Richard Jones (35), in the hallway near the kitchen. The suspect was armed with a large kitchen knife taken from within the home. After a brief confrontation, the suspect was subdued with a taser and taken into custody without further incident.

Evidence suggests the suspect's intention was to steal valuables, as an open backpack was found near the point of entry containing assorted jewelry, electronics, and other small valuables belonging to the homeowner. The total value of attempted stolen goods is estimated at $7,500.  

The homeowner was unharmed during the incident. However, moderate damage was caused to the rear window and frame during the forced entry, estimated at $800 for repairs.
