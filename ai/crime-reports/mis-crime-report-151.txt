INCIDENT REPORT
Case No: 2023-04157

Date/Time: April 21, 2023 / 2:14 AM

Victim: 
ABC Manufacturing Plant
1234 Industrial Way
Centerville, OH 45678

Summary:
On April 21st at approximately 2:14 AM, the Centerville Fire Department responded to reports of a structure fire at the ABC Manufacturing Plant on Industrial Way. Upon arrival, firefighters encountered heavy smoke and flames billowing from the east side of the building. 

Further investigation revealed that an unknown suspect(s) had gained access to the premises by cutting through the chain link perimeter fence using bolt cutters. Security footage shows a hooded individual approaching the east loading dock area carrying a red gas can. The suspect is then seen splashing an accelerant trail leading into the loading bay before igniting it with an apparent incendiary device, possibly a road flare or molotov cocktail.

The rapidly spreading flames triggered the plant's sprinkler system but caused significant damage before firefighters could contain the blaze. The loading dock area was completely destroyed and there is smoke/water damage throughout the east wing of the facility. Preliminary estimates put the property damage at over $800,000.

No injuries were reported as the plant was closed for the night. However, the fire temporarily shut down operations, impacting nearly 200 employees. Authorities are reviewing security footage and collecting evidence from the scene to identify the suspect(s) and motive behind this apparent act of arson.

The Centerville Police Department is urging anyone who may have witnessed any suspicious activity near the ABC Plant late Friday night or early Saturday morning to contact the arson investigators at (555) 555-1234.
