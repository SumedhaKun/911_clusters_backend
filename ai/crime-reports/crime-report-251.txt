Nature of Crime: Human Trafficking 

On the morning of May 18th, 2023, the Police Department's Human Trafficking Task Force received an anonymous tip regarding suspected human trafficking activities occurring at a massage parlor located at 156 Main Street. Officers were dispatched to investigate further.

Upon arrival, officers made contact with the establishment's owner, Jin Xu (34-year-old male). After presenting a search warrant, the officers proceeded to inspect the premises. Their search revealed a total of 6 females, aged approximately 18-25 years old, who appeared to be living on-site in cramped, unsanitary living quarters. 

Through interviews, it was determined that these young women were brought into the country illegally from various areas in Southeast Asia after being promised lucrative job opportunities in the United States. However, upon arrival they had their travel documents confiscated by Mr. Xu and his associates. They were then forced through intimidation tactics to live on-site and perform sexual acts in exchange for meager payments that went towards paying off inflated debts.

Further investigation revealed that Mr. Xu operated an extensive trafficking ring that recruited, harbored and transported victims across state lines for the purposes of labor and sexual exploitation. His methods relied heavily on coercion, fraud and deception of his victims who were misled about the nature of the work they would be performing.

The 6 females, who are believed to be victims of this trafficking operation, were evacuated from the premises and offered support services. Mr. Xu was placed under arrest along with 3 other individuals believed to be his associates. All parties are currently being held without bail as the investigation continues.
