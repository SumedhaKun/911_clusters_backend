POLICE REPORT

Crime Type: Aggravated Burglary

On the night of May 15th, 2023, a shocking crime took place at the residence of John and Mary Smith in the quiet suburban neighborhood of Oak Hills. According to the victims' statements, they were awakened around 2:30 AM by the sound of shattering glass.

Modes of Accessing Victim:
The perpetrators gained entry into the home by smashing the rear patio door with a crowbar. Evidence suggests they spent time casing the property, looking for the most vulnerable point of entry.

Common Tools Used to Access Secure Locations:
In addition to the crowbar, a set of lock pick tools was recovered from the scene, indicating the suspects came prepared to bypass any additional locked doors or safes within the home.

Type of Force Used: Physical Force
Once inside, the suspects violently assaulted Mr. Smith, who attempted to confront them. He sustained a broken nose, multiple contusions, and a concussion from being struck repeatedly with a blunt object.

Weapons Used in the Crime:
The suspects were armed with a crowbar, which they used to threaten the victims and as a weapon to subdue Mr. Smith. Forensic analysis also revealed the presence of a small caliber handgun, though it does not appear to have been discharged during the incident.

After incapacitating Mr. Smith, the suspects proceeded to ransack the home, stealing cash, jewelry, and electronic devices. Mrs. Smith was forced at gunpoint to open the family's safe, from which the suspects made off with additional valuables and important documents.

The victims describe the perpetrators as two Caucasian males in their mid-to-late 20s, both wearing dark clothing and ski masks to conceal their identities.

The investigation is ongoing, and law enforcement urges anyone with information about this violent home invasion to come forward. A reward is being offered for any tips leading to the identification and apprehension of the suspects.
