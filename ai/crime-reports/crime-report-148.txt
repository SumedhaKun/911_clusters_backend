POLICE INCIDENT REPORT 

Case #: 2023-04781
Date: April 12, 2023
Nature of Incident: Cybercrimes 

SUMMARY OF INCIDENT:

On April 11th, 2023, the Cyber Crimes Division received a report from VictimCorp, a major financial services company, regarding unauthorized access to their secure network systems. An initial forensic analysis determined that an unknown perpetrator or group gained entry by exploiting a previously unknown vulnerability in the company's network infrastructure.

The perpetrator(s) deployed sophisticated malware and conducted phishing attacks against VictimCorp employees to obtain credentials and move laterally through the network. Once inside, they were able to access and exfiltrate sensitive financial records, customer data, and proprietary information over an extended period.

No physical weapons or direct physical force was used in the cyber attack. However, the incident caused significant data breaches, financial losses, and damage to VictimCorp's operations and reputation. The full scope is still being investigated.

INVESTIGATIVE FINDINGS:

- Network logs show anomalous activity began on March 1st, 2023, indicating the start of the cyber attack campaign
- Malware samples retrieved have been identified as a new strain of trojan designed to provide remote access
- Phishing emails mimicked internal VictimCorp communications to trick employees into entering credentials 
- Majority of data exfiltration occurred between March 15th-April 5th while perpetrators moved through network
- Total records compromised: 7.4 million customer accounts, 82 proprietary software packages, financial projections

EVIDENCE SEIZED:
- Network activity logs from VictimCorp systems
- Samples of malware deployed during attack
- Email phishing lures used against employees  
- Device images from suspected compromised workstations

The Cyber Crimes Division, working jointly with VictimCorp's internal security team, is conducting an ongoing forensic investigation to determine full extent of data loss and identify those responsible. All available cyber forensic and investigative resources are being deployed. The FBI has been notified and may open a parallel investigation.
