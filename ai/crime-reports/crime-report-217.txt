POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case #2023-04827

Date/Time of Incident: April 12, 2023 / 2:15 AM  
Location: 257 Oak Tree Lane, Residential Property

INCIDENT SUMMARY:
On the night of April 12th, the residents of 257 Oak Tree Lane awoke to the sound of shattering glass. Upon investigating, they discovered that a window in the back of the house had been forcibly broken. Evidence at the scene indicated that a crowbar was likely used to pry open the window from the outside.

Once inside, the burglar(s) ransacked multiple rooms, overturning furniture and rifling through drawers. Moderate force appears to have been used to gain entry to a locked bedroom where the bulk of the stolen items were taken from. A safe inside the closet showed signs of being pried open, likely with the same crowbar used on the window.

Among the stolen property were jewelry, electronics, cash, and other valuables estimated at over $25,000 in total value. Of particular concern, the burglar was also armed with a knife which was brandished at the residents when they were awakened by the commotion. No physical injuries were reported.

EVIDENCE RECOVERED:
- Pry marks and shattered glass at broken window
- Crowbar located just outside window
- Shoe prints and scuffmarks throughout interior
- Fibers and hair samples
- Fingerprints on safe in bedroom

The investigation is ongoing and police are canvassing the neighborhood for any residents who may have witnessed suspicious activity.
