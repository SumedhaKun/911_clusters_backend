POLICE REPORT
Case #2023-07182
Incident: Cyber Intrusion and Data Breach

Summary of Incident:
On the morning of May 12th, 2023, the Cybercrime Division was alerted to a major data breach at GeneTech Pharmaceuticals. An unknown individual or group gained unauthorized network access to GeneTech's servers and exfiltrated terabytes of sensitive data, including proprietary research data, employee records, and client information.

Investigation:
Forensic analysis determined the perpetrator(s) utilized sophisticated hacking tools and malware to bypass GeneTech's cybersecurity defenses. Evidence suggests the criminal(s) deployed a remote access trojan (RAT) to infiltrate the network, likely delivered via a phishing email with a malicious attachment or link.

Once inside GeneTech's systems, the hacker(s) employed password cracking utilities and privilege escalation exploits to gain administrative-level access. They then used packet sniffers and data mining scripts to identify and extract valuable data caches.

The stolen data was likely exfiltrated off GeneTech's network in encrypted form using covert channels like DNS tunneling or steganography. Forensic logs indicate the breach occurred over several months through intermittent network connections, allowing the perpetrator(s) to operate undetected.

Evidence collected indicates the cyber intrusion originated from servers based in Russia, using the TOR network and VPN hosts to obfuscate the true location. However, the investigation is still ongoing to identify potential suspects or criminal organizations involved.

GeneTech has implemented incident response protocols, including taking affected systems offline, resetting all credentials, and hardening security controls. The company is also providing identity theft monitoring for affected employees and clients. Damages from the breach are still being assessed but are expected to be significant given the loss of intellectual property and legal exposure.

The Cybercrime Division is coordinating with federal law enforcement and international counterparts to track down those responsible. Any individuals with information pertaining to this case are urged to contact the authorities immediately.
