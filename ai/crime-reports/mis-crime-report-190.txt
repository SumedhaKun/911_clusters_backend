POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case #2023-04617

Crime Type: Robbery 

On the night of April 15th, 2023, a daring robbery took place at the First National Bank in downtown Metropolis. According to witness statements and evidence collected at the scene, the crime unfolded as follows:

At approximately 10:30 PM, a group of four suspects, their identities still unknown, breached the bank's security through both physical presence and online means. Two of the perpetrators managed to gain physical access to the bank premises by disabling the rear entrance lock using a commercial lock picking gun - one of the common tools used to access secure locations.

Meanwhile, their accomplices remotely hacked into the bank's security systems, temporarily disabling alarms and camera feeds through a sophisticated cyber attack. This provided a window of opportunity for the robbery to take place undetected.

Once inside, the suspects subdued the two night guards on duty using non-lethal force, employing tasers and zip ties to restrain them. However, one guard suffered a minor injury during the scuffle as he attempted to resist.

The robbers then made their way to the vault, using a thermic lance - another common tool for breaching secure areas - to melt through the vault's door lock. Within minutes, they had gained access to the vault's contents.

According to preliminary estimates, the suspects made off with approximately $2.8 million in cash, bearer bonds, and other valuables. Weapons observed at the crime scene included semi-automatic pistols, which were likely used to threaten compliance from the guards.

The suspects fled the scene in a dark-colored SUV, leaving behind very few forensic clues. The investigation is still ongoing, and authorities are urging anyone with information about this daring heist to come forward.
