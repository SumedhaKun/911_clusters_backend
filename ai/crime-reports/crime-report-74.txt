INCIDENT REPORT
Case No: 2023-04827

Date/Time of Incident: April 17, 2023 / 2:15 AM 

Location: 125 Oak Street, Parking Lot Behind Oakwood Apartments

Offense: Motor Vehicle Theft

Summary:
On the night of April 17th at approximately 2:15 AM, officers responded to a report of a motor vehicle theft in progress at the Oakwood Apartments parking lot. Upon arrival, they encountered the victim, John Smith, standing next to his red 2018 Honda Civic which had the driver's side window smashed out. 

According to Mr. Smith, he had returned home around 2:00 AM after working the late shift at his job. As he was walking across the parking lot towards his apartment building, he heard the sound of breaking glass coming from where his vehicle was parked. Mr. Smith stated that when he got closer, he witnessed an unknown male suspect inside his car, apparently using a screwdriver to hotwire the ignition in an attempt to steal the vehicle.

The suspect, upon seeing Mr. Smith approach, forcibly pushed him to the ground and fled the scene on foot, leaving behind the screwdriver inside the damaged vehicle. Despite a brief search of the area by responding officers, the suspect remains at large. 

Mr. Smith was uninjured during the altercation but his vehicle sustained damage to the driver's side window and ignition wiring as a result of the attempted motor vehicle theft and breaking and entering. Fingerprint analysis was conducted on the screwdriver and scene, but no matches were found in the system. The incident is currently under investigation and police are canvassing the area for any potential surveillance footage that may have captured the suspect.
