POLICE REPORT
Case #: 2023-04712

Crime Type: Breaking and Entering, Burglary  

On the morning of April 17th, 2023, officers responded to a call about a break-in at the Northside Electronics Store located at 548 Main Street. Upon arrival, the officers found clear signs of forced entry through the rear door of the establishment.

The store's security footage revealed that at approximately 3:15 AM, two individuals dressed in dark clothing and wearing ski masks approached the back entrance. One of the suspects used a lock pick gun to quickly disengage the lock on the metal security door. The second suspect stood watch, scanning the area for any potential witnesses or patrol cars.

Once the door was unlocked, the two suspects entered the store, taking care to avoid the motion sensors of the security system. They made their way directly to the high-value merchandise storage room by following a pre-planned route, indicating possible inside knowledge of the store layout.

Using a GSA-approved lock pick set, the suspects were able to bypass the secure storage room door. No explosive entries, power tools, or weapons were utilized during the crime.

The individuals spent approximately 27 minutes inside, clearing out a significant portion of the inventory, including laptops, tablets, smartphones, and other consumer electronics totaling an estimated $85,000 in retail value. The suspects exercised great care and employed non-destructive methods throughout, leaving behind no physical damage to the premises apart from the broken lock on the rear entrance.

After completing their sweep of the storage area, the two exited through the same rear entrance, disappearing into the night before police could arrive on the scene. No civilian injuries were reported.

Evidence collected includes high-resolution surveillance footage, which is being analyzed by forensic experts. Samples of hair, fibers, and fingerprints have also been collected and submitted for processing.

The investigation is still ongoing, and authorities are urging anyone who may have information about this incident to come forward. A reward of $10,000 is being offered for any tips leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for this professional and meticulously planned burglary.
