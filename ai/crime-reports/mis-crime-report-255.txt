POLICE REPORT
Case #: 2023-04167
Date: April 15, 2023

INCIDENT SUMMARY:
On the evening of April 14th, 2023, a call came into the station regarding a reported breaking and entering at the First Capital Bank on Main Street. Officers arrived on the scene at approximately 11:45 PM to find signs of forced entry through the rear employee entrance. 

Upon reviewing security footage, a single perpetrator can be seen approaching the back door carrying what appears to be a full lockpicking toolkit. The suspect, dressed in dark clothing with a ski mask concealing their face, is recorded skillfully manipulating the lock tumblers until the door swings open at 11:32 PM.

Once inside, the perpetrator seems to have disabled the security system, likely through lockpicking methods again to bypass the alarm panel. They then made their way to the vault room where immense force appears to have been used to breach the vault door. Pry marks and gouging indicate heavy tools like a crowbar or hydraulic jack were implemented to force the locking mechanism.

The suspect spent approximately 22 minutes inside the vault before emerging with an undisclosed amount of cash, bonds, and other valuables contained in several large duffel bags. No weapons were visible during the incident, but the level of planning and tools involved suggest this was the work of a seasoned criminal with professional lockpicking and safe-cracking abilities.

After leaving the bank, the suspect's trail goes cold. No witnesses were located and the getaway vehicle and route remain unknown. Evidence teams have processed the scene for fingerprints, DNA, and any potential security camera footage that may have captured the suspect's face during the commission of this crime.

The investigation remains open and ongoing. Any persons with information about this incident are urged to contact Detective John Barnes at 555-0176. A substantial reward is offered for any information leading to the identification, arrest, and conviction of the responsible party.
