Crime Classification: Burglary, Aggravated Assault

On the evening of April 12th, 2023, officers responded to a call regarding a home invasion in the Oakwood neighborhood. Upon arrival, they encountered a chaotic scene with the homeowners, John and Jane Doe, visibly shaken and sporting minor injuries. 

According to their statements, two masked individuals forcibly entered their residence around 10:30 PM. The perpetrators gained access by using crowbars to pry open a ground floor window after failing to pick the locks on the exterior doors.

Once inside, the suspects violently subdued the homeowners, binding their hands with zip ties and demanding valuables at knifepoint. Mr. Doe sustained a laceration to his forearm after resisting, while Mrs. Doe had bruising on her face from being struck.

The suspects proceeded to ransack the premises for approximately 45 minutes, making off with jewelry, electronics, and a substantial amount of cash. Forensic teams recovered several sets of footprints, pry marks on the window frame, and fiber traces for further analysis.

Witnesses in the neighborhood reported seeing two individuals dressed in dark clothing fleeing the scene in a late-model sedan, but were unable to provide a more detailed description or license plate number.

The investigation is still ongoing, and authorities are urging anyone with information about this incident or the suspects' whereabouts to come forward. Citizens are advised to remain vigilant, secure their homes, and report any suspicious activity immediately.
