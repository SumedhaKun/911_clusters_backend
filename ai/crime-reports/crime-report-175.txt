POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case #2023-04182

Crime: Obstruction of Justice

On April 18th, 2023, at approximately 3:15 PM, officers responded to a call regarding a disturbance at the Mayfield County Courthouse. Upon arrival, officers encountered an agitated individual, later identified as Samuel Jacobs (DOB: 12/03/1985), causing a commotion in the main lobby.  

According to witness statements, Jacobs had entered the courthouse and proceeded to loudly berate and verbally harass several court officials, including a judge who was presiding over a high-profile case. Jacobs's erratic behavior and repeated interruptions during court proceedings led to a delay in the trial's schedule.  

When instructed by bailiffs to leave the premises, Jacobs became increasingly belligerent and refused to comply with orders. At one point, he physically resisted attempts by court officers to escort him out, engaging in a brief struggle before finally being subdued and taken into custody.

Witness testimonies and surveillance footage corroborate that Jacobs did not utilize any tools or weapons during the incident. However, his actions deliberately interfered with the administration of justice and disrupted official court proceedings through the use of vocal outbursts and physical resistance against court officers.

Jacobs was charged with Obstruction of Justice, Disorderly Conduct, and Resisting Arrest. He was processed at the county jail and is currently being held on a $25,000 bond pending further legal proceedings.

The investigation into potential motives behind Jacobs's actions is ongoing. Authorities are also reviewing the court's security protocols to prevent similar disruptions from occurring in the future.
