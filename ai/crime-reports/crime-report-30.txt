Summary of Incident:
On April 17th at approximately 2:35 AM, a burglary occurred at 215 Oak Street, Apartment 3B. The residents, John and Sarah Davis, were awoken by a loud crashing sound coming from their living room. Upon investigating, they discovered an unknown male suspect had used a crowbar to break through one of the front windows to gain entry into their apartment. 

The suspect confronted the victims brandishing a large kitchen knife. He demanded any valuables and cash they had. Fearing for their safety, the Davises complied and handed over a purse containing $220 in cash, an iPhone 12, and Mrs. Davis's jewelry box. 

After obtaining these items, the suspect struck Mr. Davis in the head with the crowbar, causing a laceration and rendering him temporarily unconscious. He then fled the scene through the same broken window.

Responding officers arrived at 2:47 AM after receiving a 911 call from a neighbor who heard the commotion. The apartment was processed for evidence, including fingerprints and DNA samples from the blood left behind. The crowbar used to break the window was collected from the scene.

The suspect is described as a white male, approximately 5'10" tall with a slim build. He was wearing a black hooded sweatshirt, blue jeans, and black sneakers at the time of the incident. His face was partially covered with a ski mask.

Mr. Davis was treated at the scene by paramedics for the laceration on his head and a possible concussion. Mrs. Davis was unharmed but shaken up by the incident.

The investigation is ongoing as the suspect remains at large. Neighbors in the area are being interviewed and any available security camera footage is being reviewed in hopes of identifying the perpetrator.

This case has been assigned to Detective Mark Henderson of the Burglary/Robbery division. Any persons with information regarding this incident are urged to contact the police department immediately.
