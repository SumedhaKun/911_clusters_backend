INCIDENT REPORT

Case Number: 2023-04611
Date/Time Reported: 04/17/2023 03:24 AM  
Location: 125 Main St, Oakwood, NY 11223

Crime Type: Burglary

On the morning of April 17th at approximately 3:24 AM, officers responded to a call regarding a break-in at the Oakwood Community Bank. Upon arrival, the officers discovered that the rear entrance had been forcibly breached using a crowbar and a glass cutter. 

According to the bank manager, who was contacted shortly after the alarm was triggered, the vault remained intact. However, the safe deposit box area had been ransacked. An initial inventory indicates that several safe deposit boxes were broken into, and their contents stolen.

Modes of Accessing Victims: 
The perpetrators appeared to have intimate knowledge of the bank's layout and security protocols. They likely studied the staff entry and exit routines to determine the optimal time for the break-in when the bank would be vacant. 

Tools Used to Access Secure Locations:
In addition to the crowbar and glass cutter used to gain entry, spray paint was discovered on the hallway leading to the safe deposit box area. It appears the suspects used the spray paint to obscure the security cameras' field of view temporarily.

Type of Force Used: 
No evidence of excessive force was discovered at the scene. The perpetrators seemed to rely more on stealth and planning than brute force.

Weapons Used in the Crime:
No weapons were reported to have been used during the commission of this crime.

The crime scene has been processed, and evidence has been collected for further analysis. The Oakwood Police Department requests that anyone with information about this incident contact them immediately. The investigation is ongoing.
