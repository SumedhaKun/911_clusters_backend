Here is a detailed police report for a fictional crime involving lock picking:

POLICE REPORT
Case #2023-04785

Crime Type: Burglary

On the night of April 12th, 2023, a burglary occurred at the Downtown Art Museum. The perpetrator(s) gained access to the museum through highly skilled lock picking techniques. 

The museum's state-of-the-art security system was breached sometime between 2:00 AM and 4:00 AM based on surveillance footage. The burglar(s) exhibited an expert level of lock picking abilities, using specialized tools to defeat the museum's high-security locks on exterior doors and interior galleries.

Once inside, the perpetrator(s) targeted the museum's antiquities wing, specifically the ancient Mesopotamian artifacts collection. Priceless cuneiform tablets, gold jewelry, and ceremonial weapons dating back over 4,000 years were stolen. Estimated value of items taken exceeds $10 million.

Surveillance cameras captured images of what appears to be a single perpetrator dressed in non-descript black clothing and a facemask. The individual moved with purposeful precision, indicating potential prior military or specialized training. Lockpicking tools and equipment were visible on the perpetrator's person.

No force was used to access the interior once entry was gained through lockpicking of exterior doors. However, the perpetrator did brandish what seemed to be a suppressed pistol when a night security guard appeared unexpectedly. The guard was struck in the head and temporarily incapacitated, but is expected to recover.

At this time, the identity and potential motives remain unknown. Law enforcement is investigating any potential links to underground antiquities trafficking rings or solicited theft by private collectors. Experts in lockpicking and museum security have been consulted.

The Downtown Art Museum is closed indefinitely while the crime scene is processed and an overhaul of security protocols is implemented. A $100,000 reward has been issued for any information leading to arrests in this high-stakes burglary case.
