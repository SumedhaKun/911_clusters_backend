POLICE INCIDENT REPORT

Case #: 2023-04785
Crime Type: Burglary 
Date/Time of Incident: April 17, 2023 - 2:15 AM

Reported By: John Smith, Homeowner
Address of Incident: 123 Oak Street, Oakville

Narrative:
On April 17th at approximately 2:15 AM, a burglary occurred at the residence of John and Jane Smith located at 123 Oak Street. The perpetrator(s) used common burglary tools such as a lockpick set and a pry bar to gain access through a ground floor window at the rear of the home. 

Modes of accessing the victim were clearly premeditated, as the burglar(s) appeared to case the property prior to the incident. They cut through the backyard fence and disabled the motion sensor lights to avoid detection. Minimal force was used, as the victims were asleep upstairs during the burglary.

Once inside, the burglar(s) stole electronics such as laptops, tablets, and gaming systems from the downstairs den. They also took jewelry, cash, and other valuables. No weapons were brandished during the crime. 

Evidence at the scene included pry marks on the window frame, muddy footprints leading to the broken fence, and the disabled motion sensor lights. Forensics is examining these for potential DNA and fingerprint evidence.

The estimated total loss is approximately $25,000. The victims were unharmed physically, but are understandably shaken up by this invasion of their home and property.

The investigation is ongoing. Anyone with information about this incident is urged to contact the Oakville Police Department immediately.

Reporting Officer: Det. Sarah Johnson, Badge #7706
