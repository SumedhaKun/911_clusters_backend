Location: Downtown City Hall, Mayor's Office

INCIDENT DETAILS:
On the afternoon of April 15th, a report was filed alleging bribery involving the mayor's chief of staff, Samuel Wilkins. According to the complainant, a prominent local developer named Marcus Radcliffe attempted to unlawfully influence Mr. Wilkins regarding an upcoming zoning decision for one of Radcliffe's construction projects.

The details provided state that on April 13th, Mr. Radcliffe visited Mr. Wilkins' office and offered him an expensive luxury wristwatch valued at over $10,000 in exchange for ensuring that the zoning proposal would be approved without issue. Witnesses reported seeing Mr. Radcliffe entering and leaving the mayor's office carrying a small gift box.  

Video surveillance footage from City Hall corroborates the witness accounts, showing Mr. Radcliffe accessing Mr. Wilkins' office suite and remaining inside for approximately 25 minutes during the alleged bribery attempt.

No weapons or force were used during the commission of this alleged bribery. However, the investigation is still ongoing regarding the full extent of the activities between the two parties.
