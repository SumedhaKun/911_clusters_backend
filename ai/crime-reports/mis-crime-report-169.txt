POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case #2023-04187

Crime Type: Burglary
Date/Time of Incident: April 17, 2023 / 2:15 AM 

Location: 825 Oak Tree Lane, Oakwood

Victim(s): 
John and Mary Roberts
825 Oak Tree Lane
Oakwood, VA 22555

Details of Incident:
On the morning of April 17th at approximately 2:15 AM, the Oakwood Police Department received a call from the residence of John and Mary Roberts reporting a home invasion and burglary. 

Upon arrival, officers found clear signs of a forced entry. The perpetrator(s) appeared to have used lock picking tools to bypass the front door lock, allowing access into the home while the residents were asleep upstairs. 

Once inside, the burglar(s) thoroughly ransacked the first floor, going through drawers, closets, and overturning furniture. An antique vase valued at approximately $5,000 was stolen from the living room, along with a flat screen TV, two laptop computers, and an unknown amount of cash and jewelry taken from the study.

The perpetrator(s) utilized physical force to gain compliance from the victims. Mr. Roberts sustained a minor laceration to the head after being struck, presumably with the butt of a blunt object. Mrs. Roberts also had bruising on her arms consistent with being forcibly restrained.

No firearms or other deadly weapons appear to have been used during the commission of this crime. The victims were bound with zip ties and duct tape that the perpetrator(s) brought to the scene.

Evidence collected at the scene includes:
- Shoe prints and partial fingerprints lifted from various surfaces
- Torn pieces of black clothing, potentially from perpetrator's disguise
- Set of lock picking tools found near point of entry

The suspect(s) made their escape out the back door, leaving the area on foot based on neighborhood canvas interviews. The total loss from the stolen goods is estimated at $27,500.

This case has been assigned to Detective Mark Johnson. All neighbors are asked to review any home surveillance footage from the overnight hours and report any suspicious activity immediately.
