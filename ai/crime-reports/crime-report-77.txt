POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case #2023-04159

Date: April 22, 2023
Time: 2:15 AM  
Location: 187 Maple Street, Oakwood

Reported Crime: Arson

Summary of Incident:
On the morning of April 22nd at approximately 2:15 AM, the Oakwood Fire Department received a call about a structure fire at 187 Maple Street. Upon arrival, the two-story residential home was fully engulfed in flames. It took fire crews nearly two hours to extinguish the blaze.

According to witness statements and evidence collected at the scene, this fire was intentionally set and an act of arson. A neighbor reported seeing a hooded figure entering the side door of the residence shortly before smoke started billowing out. Footprints were found leading up to a broken window on the first floor where the perpetrator appears to have entered the building.

Inside, investigators uncovered several points of origin for the fire on both floors of the home. Traces of an accelerant, believed to be lighter fluid, were detected. Multiple partially burned matches and lighters were also recovered as evidence. The fire caused massive structural damage, rendering the home uninhabitable.

Thankfully, the residents were not present at the time the fire was set, as they were out of town on vacation. However, two of their pet dogs perished in the blaze. The homeowners, the Wilson family, have been notified and are cooperating with law enforcement.

Evidence suggests this was a targeted and premeditated attack, likely by someone holding a grudge against the victims. Neighbors did not report seeing any vehicles or get a clear description of the arsonist due to the late hour.  

The investigation is still active and ongoing. Police are canvassing the neighborhood for any other witnesses or surveillance footage that could help identify the perpetrator. A reward of $10,000 is being offered for any information leading to an arrest and conviction in this case.
