On the morning of April 12th at approximately 5:45 AM, the Oakwood Police Department received a call from a resident at 215 Oak Tree Lane reporting a burglary at their home. Officers were dispatched to the scene immediately.

Upon arrival, officers found clear signs of a forced entry through a rear window of the residence. The window had been broken, with shards of glass on the ground outside and inside the home. A large crowbar lay on the floor just inside, likely the tool used to pry open the window frame.

- Crowbar with potential fingerprints 
- Shoeprints outside the broken window
- Fibers/hair sample from the hallway scuffle
