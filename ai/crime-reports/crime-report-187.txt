POLICE REPORT
Case #: 2023-04785

Crime: Carjacking 

Date/Time: April 17, 2023 - 11:28 PM

Location: Parking lot behind Main Street Diner, 125 Main St, Oakwood

Victim:
John Smith, 37-year-old male
125 Oak Road, Oakwood

On the evening of April 17th, the victim, John Smith, had just finished his shift as a line cook at the Main Street Diner. He walked out to the parking lot behind the diner around 11:25 PM to head home after work. 

As he approached his silver 2019 Honda Civic, two unknown male suspects emerged from behind a dumpster. One suspect, dressed in a black hoodie and ski mask, approached Mr. Smith from behind and put him in a choke hold, restricting his breathing. 

The other suspect, wearing a red baseball cap, dark sunglasses, and a bandana covering his face, approached Mr. Smith from the front. He brandished a black semi-automatic handgun and pressed it against the victim's temple.

The armed suspect shouted "Give me your damn keys and wallet or I'll blow your head off!" 

Mr. Smith complied, fumbling to retrieve his car keys and wallet from his pockets with the other suspect's arm still restricting his breathing. He dropped the items on the ground.

The suspect in the red cap retrieved the keys and wallet while the other suspect shoved Mr. Smith to the ground. Both suspects then entered the victim's Honda Civic and fled the scene at a high rate of speed.

The victim was shaken but did not require medical attention. He immediately called 911 to report the crime.

Evidence collected at the scene included a baseball cap dropped by one of the suspects and tire imprints from the victim's vehicle.

The investigation is ongoing. Any persons with information about this crime are urged to contact the Oakwood Police Department at (555) 555-1234.
