INCIDENT REPORT
Case #: 2023-047891
Date: April 15, 2023
Location: 315 Elmwood Ave, Oakville 

INCIDENT DETAILS:
On the night of April 15th, 2023, a report of vandalism was called in by a local resident regarding the abandoned Oakville Furniture Factory on 315 Elmwood Ave. Upon arrival, officers discovered significant damage to the property. 

The perpetrator(s) appeared to have used a sledgehammer to forcibly break into the derelict building through a side entrance. Once inside, they proceeded to smash numerous walls, windows, and interior structures in what seems to be a random act of destructive vandalism.

No witnesses were present at the time of the incident, but evidence at the scene included:
- A sledgehammer found lying amidst the rubble
- Shattered glass and debris scattered throughout the building
- Numerous holes in drywall and crumbling interior walls

No other tools, weapons, or evidence suggesting a motive beyond mindless property destruction were recovered. The estimated cost of damages is currently unknown but expected to be significant given the state of disrepair the building was left in.

Officers canvassed the neighborhood but were unable to locate any potential suspects or camera footage of the incident taking place. The investigation is still ongoing. Anyone with any information is urged to contact the Oakville Police Department's tip line.

Reporting Officers:
Ofc. J. Patterson (Badge #27)
