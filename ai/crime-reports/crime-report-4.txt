Here is a detailed police report for a fraud case involving hacking into a victim's online banking account:

POLICE REPORT
Case #: 2023-04112
Date of Incident: April 5, 2023
Crime: Fraud, Unauthorized Access to Computer Systems

Summary of Incident:
On April 5th, 2023, the victim (name redacted for privacy) reported that their online banking account had been illegally accessed and funds had been fraudulently transferred out. The total amount stolen was $27,500. 

The victim stated that they had not shared their login credentials with anyone and there was no sign of physical break-in or theft at their residence. Cyber forensics revealed that the victim's account was accessed remotely by an unknown perpetrator through sophisticated hacking methods.

Details of the Crime:
The perpetrator(s) gained unauthorized access to the victim's personal computer through malware, likely delivered via a phishing email or infected website. Using specialized hacking software and computer skills, they were able to bypass security protocols and break into the victim's online banking credentials.

Once inside the account, the perpetrator(s) initiated a series of wire transfers from the victim's accounts to multiple destinations around the world in an attempt to launder the stolen funds and cover their tracks. The transactions were made to appear legitimate through spoofed accounts and fake front companies.

No force or weapons were used during the cyber crime. However, the perpetrator(s) employed deception, malicious code, and illegal hacking practices to virtually trespass, steal data, and siphon money from the victim's accounts.

Evidence:
- Forensic analysis of the victim's computer showing malware infection and remote access by an outside IP address
- Logs from the bank's security system showing unauthorized logins and fraudulent transactions
- Blockchain analysis tracing the flow of stolen cryptocurrency funds

The investigation is still ongoing as law enforcement attempts to track down the cyber trail and identify the perpetrator(s) behind this cyber fraud and theft incident. Any individuals with information about this case are urged to contact the cyber crimes unit immediately.
