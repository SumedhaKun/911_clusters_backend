Date of Report: April 18, 2023

INCIDENT DETAILS:
Type of Crime: Embezzlement 
Location: Acme Corporation, 123 Main St.

SUMMARY:
On April 15th, 2023, a report was filed by the Chief Financial Officer of Acme Corporation regarding suspicions of embezzlement by a senior accounting manager, John Doe. An internal audit revealed discrepancies in financial records and unauthorized transfers from company accounts into personal accounts belonging to Doe.

INVESTIGATION:
Interviews with accounting department staff and a forensic audit trail indicated that Doe had been systematically siphoning funds from Acme Corporation over the past 18 months. He gained unauthorized access to company funds by exploiting his administrator privileges and overriding financial controls.

The methods used were:
- Making fraudulent entries in the accounting system to mask fund transfers
- Creating shell vendor accounts to funnel payments into his personal accounts
- Using the company credit card and bank account information to make unauthorized purchases and cash withdrawals for personal gain

The total amount embezzled is estimated to be $825,000.

No force or weapons were used in the commission of this crime, as Doe's position granted him access to financial systems and accounts.

EVIDENCE COLLECTED:
- Financial records and audit trails from Acme Corporation
- Bank statements from Doe's personal accounts showing large deposits
- Receipts and invoices for personal purchases made with company funds
- Doe's company-issued credit cards and bank access devices

CHARGES:
John Doe has been charged with embezzlement, fraud, money laundering, and misuse of company property and funds. He is currently in custody awaiting trial.

CASE STATUS: Open and ongoing investigation to determine if there were additional co-conspirators involved.
