Case #: 2023-04891
Incident Type: Trespassing
Date/Time: April 12, 2023 / 11:45 PM 
Location: 215 Oak Grove Lane, Oakwood

SUMMARY OF INCIDENT:
On the evening of April 12th, officers responded to a trespassing call at the residence of Mr. and Mrs. Thompson at 215 Oak Grove Lane. Upon arrival, officers discovered an unknown male suspect had illegally entered the property by climbing over the backyard fence. 

The homeowners, who were upstairs at the time, heard noises coming from their backyard and immediately called 911. When officers arrived, they found the suspect wandering aimlessly on the lawn behind the home. The suspect, who appeared confused and disoriented, was unarmed and did not resist arrest.

Officers conducted a search and found no tools or weapons on the suspect or signs of forced entry into the home itself. It appears the suspect's sole crime was trespassing onto the private property by climbing the 6-foot tall wooden fence.

White male
Approximately 25-30 years old
6'0" tall, 180 lbs
Short brown hair, blue eyes
Wearing a green t-shirt, blue jeans, and sneakers

The suspect would not cooperate with officers or identify himself. He has been booked into county jail on charges of criminal trespassing pending his identification and further investigation.
