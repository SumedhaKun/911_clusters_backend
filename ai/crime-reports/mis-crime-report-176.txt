POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case No. 2023-0416-0087

Crime Type: Aggravated Burglary

On April 16th, 2023, at approximately 2:15 AM, the Maple Ridge Police Department received a 911 call reporting a home invasion in progress at 578 Oak Tree Lane. Officers were dispatched to the scene immediately. 

Upon arrival, officers encountered a chaotic and volatile situation. The front door of the residence had been forcibly kicked in, leaving it damaged and ajar. Shouts and scuffling sounds could be heard coming from inside the home.

Modes of Accessing Victim: After announcing their presence, the officers entered the residence to find the homeowners, a married couple in their late 50s, being physically assaulted and restrained by three male suspects. The suspects had gained entry by kicking in the front door.

Common Tools Used to Access Secure Locations: In addition to using physical force to breach the front entrance, the suspects were found in possession of a crowbar, a small pry bar, and a lock pick set, suggesting they came prepared with tools to bypass any other locked doors or windows.

Type of Force Used: <typeofforceused>Physical force</typeofforceused> was employed by the suspects. Both victims showed signs of blunt force trauma with bruising, lacerations, and the husband had a suspected broken nose from being struck in the face.

Weapons Used in the Crime: During the confrontation with police, one suspect brandished a 9mm semi-automatic handgun and threatened to shoot the officers. Another suspect had a large hunting knife tucked into his waistband. The third suspect was unarmed but violently resisting arrest.

After a tense standoff, the officers were able to subdue the suspects through use of non-lethal force and take them into custody. A search of the premises uncovered a duffel bag filled with electronic devices, jewelry, and other valuables that were presumably stolen from the residence during the home invasion.

The victims were transported to Mercy General Hospital for treatment of their injuries. Their conditions are currently listed as stable.

The three suspects, identified as brothers Logan (28), Caleb (25), and Jared Reynolds (22), are being held at the county jail pending charges of aggravated burglary, assault, armed robbery, and multiple other felony counts related to this incident.

The investigation into the full circumstances surrounding this violent home invasion remains ongoing. More details will be provided as they become available.
