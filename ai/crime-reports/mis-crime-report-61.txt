POLICE REPORT
Case #28475

Crime Type: Murder 

Date/Time: April 12th, 2023, approximately 11:45 PM

Location: 495 Pine Ridge Drive, Parkville

Victim: 
John Roberts, 57 years old, Caucasian male

Summary of Events:
On the evening of April 12th, a brutal murder took place at the upscale residence of John Roberts. The victim was found deceased in his home study by his wife Diane Roberts upon returning home from a night out with friends. 

The perpetrators appear to have gained access to the property by picking the lock on a ground-floor window in the rear of the home. Tool marks on the window frame indicate the use of a professional lock pick set. Once inside, they made their way to the study, where Roberts was apparently confronted.

Evidence at the scene suggests an extreme level of force was used to subdue the victim. Defensive wounds on Roberts' hands and arms show he put up a struggle against his attackers. The fatal blow was a single gunshot wound to the chest from what appears to be a .38 caliber revolver. No money or valuables were taken from the home, lending to the possibility that this was not a robbery gone wrong.

Motive for the homicide is unknown at this time. Roberts was a wealthy venture capitalist with no obvious enemies. Detectives are exploring both personal and professional angles. More evidence is needed to determine if this was a targeted killing or simply a random act of violence.

Witnesses:
- Diane Roberts (wife) was not present during the crime

Evidence:
- Bullet casing from .38 caliber revolver
- Toolmark impressions on ground floor window frame
- Defensive wounds on victim's body
