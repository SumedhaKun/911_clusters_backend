POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case No: 2023-04617

Crime: Kidnapping 

Date/Time: April 12, 2023 / 10:32 PM

Location: 415 Oak Tree Lane, Residential Neighborhood

Victim: 
John Davis, 32 years old
Resident at address

On the evening of April 12th, the victim John Davis reported that he was abducted at gunpoint from his home located at 415 Oak Tree Lane. Davis stated that at approximately 10:30 PM, he was entering his residence after parking his vehicle in the driveway. As he was walking up to the front door, a masked male subject approached him from behind, pressed a handgun into his back, and ordered him not to make any noise or sudden movements.

The subject then forcibly pushed Davis back towards his vehicle, a blue 2019 Honda Civic, and demanded he get into the driver's seat at gunpoint. Davis complied out of fear for his life. The subject entered the rear passenger seat area, keeping the handgun pointed at the victim. He then ordered Davis to drive away from the residence, making threats that if he did not cooperate he would be killed.

Davis followed the subject's instructions and drove for approximately 20 minutes until they reached an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town. There, the subject ordered Davis out of the vehicle at gunpoint and had him enter the warehouse. Once inside, the subject bound the victim's hands behind his back with zip ties and confined him to a small room, again threatening lethal force if he tried to escape or make any noise.

The subject did not make any specific ransom demands at that time and left Davis secured in the room. Davis waited several hours until he could no longer hear any noise from the warehouse. He then struggled to loosen the zipties and escaped through a window to a nearby business where he was able to contact the police.

The kidnapping appears to be a random act, and the motive is unclear at this time. The suspect remains at large and is described as:

- Male
- Approximately 5'10" - 6' tall 
- Medium build
- Dressed in dark clothing with a ski mask covering his face
- Armed with a black semiautomatic handgun

Evidence collected at the crime scenes includes zipties, shoe prints, surveillance footage, and trace evidence. The investigation is ongoing as detectives attempt to identify the perpetrator.
