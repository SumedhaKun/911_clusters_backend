POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case No: 2023-04789

Crime: Fraud - Identity Theft  

Date/Time: April 15, 2023 / Unknown

Location: Various

Victim: John K. Andersen, 47-year-old male

Details:
On April 20th, 2023, the victim John K. Andersen reported that his identity had been stolen and fraudulently used. Mr. Andersen first became aware of the fraud when he received notifications from his bank about suspicious charges on his credit card accounts totaling over $25,000 at various retailers he did not recognize. 

Upon further investigation, it was discovered that the perpetrator(s) had illegally obtained Mr. Andersen's personal information, including his social security number, date of birth, address, credit card numbers, and other sensitive data. The stolen personal information was then used to open several credit card accounts in the victim's name without his authorization or knowledge.

Over a period of three months, the fraudsters went on a massive spending spree using the illegitimate credit accounts they opened. Charges ranged from luxury clothing and electronics purchases to financing a high-end sports car. The perpetrators appeared to have sophisticated techniques to bypass security verification checks during the application process.

No signs of forced entry or physical violence were reported, as the crime was committed remotely by exploiting vulnerabilities in data security systems to access Mr. Andersen's personal records. No weapons were used in the course of this crime.

The victim is currently working with his financial institutions, credit monitoring agencies, and the police to resolve the fraudulent activities and repair the damage to his credit history and finances. The investigation into identifying the perpetrator(s) is ongoing based on purchase records, surveillance footage, and digital forensics.
