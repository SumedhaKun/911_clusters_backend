POLICE REPORT

Case Number: 2023-04215

Crime: Robbery 

Date: April 21, 2023
Time: Approximately 11:30 PM
Location: 125 Oak Street, Centerville

Victim:
John Roberts, 32-year-old male

Suspects: 
Three unknown males, estimated between 25-35 years old

Incident Summary:
On the night of April 21st, Mr. Roberts was walking home alone after getting off his shift at a local restaurant. As he was passing through Oak Street Park, he was ambushed by three male suspects. 

The suspects appeared to have been lying in wait, strategically choosing a secluded area of the park surrounded by thick shrubbery. One suspect emerged from the bushes wielding a baseball bat and struck Mr. Roberts in the back of the head, immediately disorienting him.

The two other suspects then rushed Mr. Roberts, pinning him to the ground. One suspect brandished a switchblade knife and held it to the victim's throat while viciously demanding he "hand over his money and valuables."

Fearing for his life, Mr. Roberts complied and surrendered his wallet containing $85 in cash, his iPhone 12, and a gold wristwatch (model and value unknown). The suspects then forcibly removed the victim's shoes and jacket before fleeing the scene on foot.

Mr. Roberts was transported to Centerville General Hospital, where he received treatment for a moderate concussion and lacerations to his face and hands sustained during the assault.

Evidence Recovered:
- Bloodstained baseball bat
- Pry bar
- Discarded jacket belonging to the victim

The investigation is ongoing. Any persons with knowledge of this incident are urged to call the Centerville Police Department's tip line.
