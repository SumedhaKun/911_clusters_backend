Police Report #2023-0415

Nature of Incident: Burglary/Theft 

On April 15th, 2023 at approximately 2:30 AM, officers responded to a residential burglary at 415 Oak Street. Upon arrival, they found signs of a forced entry through the front door. The door frame was badly damaged, with clear marks indicating the use of pry bars and other tools to forcibly open it.

The homeowners, John and Jane Smith, reported that they were awoken by loud banging noises coming from the front of the house. Mr. Smith went to investigate and saw at least one shadowy figure fleeing out the front door. He gave chase briefly but the suspect(s) managed to escape.

Upon clearing the residence, it was determined that the suspect(s) had gained entry by using lockpicking tools to first bypass the front door lock. When that failed, they resorted to using pry bars to physically force the door open, causing significant damage. 

Once inside, the suspect(s) stole a large flatscreen TV from the living room, a laptop computer and jewelry box from the master bedroom, and multiple handbags/purses from the front closet area. Drawers and cabinets throughout the home were left open, indicating the suspect(s) had rummaged through looking for valuables. No weapons were seen or reported as being used.

Evidence collected at the scene included shoe prints and tool marks on the front door, potential fingerprints on the damaged lock area, and jewelry boxes that had been knocked over. The total value of the stolen goods is estimated at over $7,500.

The suspect(s) employed a brazen use of physical force and tools to gain entry, indicating a high level of determination. Canvassing the neighborhood found no other witnesses. The investigation is ongoing as police review evidence and follow up on any leads.
