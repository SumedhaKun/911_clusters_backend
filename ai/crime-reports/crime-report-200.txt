Police Report #2023-0416

Date: April 16, 2023
Offense: Burglary, Theft 

On April 16th at approximately 2:35 AM, officers responded to a residential burglary alarm at 457 Oak Tree Lane. Upon arrival, they found signs of forced entry through the front door. The door frame was heavily damaged, with clear marks from what appeared to be a pry bar used to forcibly open it. 

The homeowners, John and Jane Smith, were not present at the time as they were out of town on vacation. However, their 19-year-old son Michael was home alone when the incident occurred.

According to Michael's statement, he was awoken by loud banging noises coming from the front of the house. He stayed in his upstairs bedroom and immediately called 911. While on the line with dispatch, Michael heard voices and footsteps moving through the first floor.

The perpetrators seemed to have disabled the home security system, as the alarm did not sound until they attempted to exit through the front door again after committing the burglary.

An initial sweep of the home found that the master bedroom had been ransacked, with drawers pulled out and contents strewn about. Multiple pieces of valuable jewelry were reported missing, including:

- A 2 carat diamond engagement ring
- A Rolex Submariner watch 
- A strand of Mikimoto pearls

There were no signs of forced entry into the other rooms or the home safe, indicating the burglars may have been scared off by the arrival of police.

Forensics teams found several sets of footprints around the perimeter as well as a few discarded tools - namely a pry bar and a set of lock picking rakes and tension wrenches. These items have been collected as evidence.

The burglars appeared to have cased the home in advance, as they knew the homeowners were away and the son was alone. They likely monitored the home for an opportunity to break in when Michael was upstairs.

Suspects are still at large, but the evidence collected provides promising leads. Canvassing of nearby homes with security cameras is ongoing to identify any potential vehicles or additional suspects involved.

This case remains open and an active investigation. Any witnesses or those with additional information are urged to contact the police department immediately.
