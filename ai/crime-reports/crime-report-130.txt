Crime Type: Kidnapping

Summary of Incident:
On the evening of April 18th, 2023, a brazen kidnapping took place in the quiet suburb of Cedarwood. The victim, Sarah Thompson (28), was forcibly abducted at gunpoint from her residence at 215 Oak Lane by an unknown assailant.

According to the victim's statement, she had just returned home from work around 7:45 PM when the perpetrator ambushed her as she exited her vehicle in the driveway. The assailant, described as a tall male wearing a black ski mask, shoved what appeared to be a handgun into her ribs and ordered her not to make any noise.

Wielding the firearm as a threat of violence, the kidnapper forced Ms. Thompson back into her car, a blue 2019 Honda Civic. He then commandeered the vehicle with the victim still inside, driving away at high speed. The vehicle was last seen heading east on Oak Lane by a neighbor out walking their dog.  

Evidence collected at the scene includes tire impressions from the victim's driveway, which have been sent to the forensics lab for analysis. A spent .38 caliber shell casing was also recovered, indicating the handgun was loaded and operational.

As of this report, the victim's whereabouts and the motive behind the kidnapping remain unknown. A ransom demand has not been received by the family. The investigation is ongoing, and all available resources are being utilized to safely locate and recover Ms. Thompson.

This case has been flagged as a high priority by the department. Anyone with any information regarding this incident is urged to immediately contact the Cedarwood Police Department tip line at 555-0192.
