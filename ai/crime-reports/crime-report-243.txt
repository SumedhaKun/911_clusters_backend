INCIDENT REPORT
Case #: 2023-04572
Date: April 15, 2023
Location: 215 Main St, Apartment 3B

INCIDENT DETAILS:
On the evening of April 15th, the Arson Investigation Unit responded to a call of a structure fire at 215 Main St, a six-unit apartment building. Upon arrival, smoke was billowing from the third floor windows of Apartment 3B. 

The fire department was able to contain and extinguish the blaze, however the interior of Apartment 3B suffered extensive fire, smoke, and water damage. A subsequent investigation determined the fire was intentionally set through the use of an open flame ignition source, likely a lighter or matches.

Interviews were conducted with residents who reported seeing a male suspect forcibly entering Apartment 3B earlier in the evening by kicking in the front door. The suspect, who remains at large, was described as a white male in his 30s, approximately 5'10" tall with a slim build and short brown hair.

Evidence recovered at the scene includes scuff marks on the door frame consistent with it being forcibly kicked open. Traces of an accelerant, believed to be lighter fluid, were detected in multiple locations within the main living area. No other weapons besides the ignition source were involved.

The motivation remains under investigation, but arson is suspected as this was the residence of the estranged wife of a person of interest in the case. Estimated damages exceed $75,000 to the structure and contents of Apartment 3B. No injuries were reported.

The Arson Investigation Unit is continuing to process evidence and follow up on leads related to this brazen act of arson. Anyone with information is urged to contact the Police Department at...
