Here is a detailed fictional police report for an assault crime:

POLICE REPORT
Case #2023-04187
Crime: Assault 

On the evening of April 12th, 2023, officers responded to a call about an assault in progress at the downtown branch of First National Bank. Upon arrival, officers encountered a chaotic scene.

The Incident:
The perpetrators, two males estimated to be in their late 20s to early 30s, gained access to the bank through an unlocked rear entrance typically used by employees. Security camera footage shows the suspects were able to bypass the security system by using a device to clone an employee key card. 

Once inside, the suspects confronted and physically assaulted two bank employees who were working late. Witness statements indicate the suspects used physical force, including punching and kicking, to subdue the victims. One victim, a 32-year-old male teller, sustained a broken nose and facial lacerations. The other victim, a 28-year-old female manager, suffered a concussion after being struck in the head.

After assaulting the employees, the suspects made their way to the vault. It appears they had knowledge of the vault's mechanisms, as they were able to open it using a portable thermal lance cutting tool. An undisclosed amount of cash was taken from the vault before the suspects fled the scene on foot.

Evidence:
- Security camera footage showing the suspects entering and leaving
- Cloned employee key card used to bypass security 
- Thermal lance cutting tool found near the open vault
- DNA evidence (blood) from one of the victims found on a suspect's clothing

The suspects are still at large and an active investigation is ongoing. Anyone with information about this incident is urged to contact the police department's tip line immediately.
