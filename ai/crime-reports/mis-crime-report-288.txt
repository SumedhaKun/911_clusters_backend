Location: 457 Maple Lane, Oakwood

Victim:
John Roberts, 38-year-old male resident

Narrative:
On April 12th at approximately 2:37 AM, officers responded to a 911 call reporting a burglary in progress at 457 Maple Lane. Upon arrival, officers found the front door kicked in and heard sounds of a struggle from within the residence. 

Officers entered and located the victim, John Roberts, who had sustained head injuries after being physically assaulted by the burglars. Roberts stated that he was awoken by loud noises and went to investigate, at which point he was attacked by 2-3 masked intruders.

The suspects appeared to have gained entry by picking the front door lock using a lock pick gun and a rake pick, common burglary tools. Once inside, they used physical force and struck Roberts in the head with an unknown blunt object, potentially a baseball bat or crowbar found at the scene covered in blood.

Roberts was unable to provide descriptions beyond the suspects were males wearing dark clothing and masks. Evidence at the scene indicates the burglars thoroughly ransacked the home, though the full extent of items stolen is unknown at this time. 

The suspects fled out the back door prior to police arrival. A canvass of the neighborhood was conducted but no suspects were located. The investigation is ongoing as forensic evidence is processed.

This was an act of extreme violence with the suspects showing a complete disregard for human life. Residents are urged to keep doors and windows locked, be alert to any suspicious activity, and call 911 immediately if they have any information related to this crime.
