POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case #: 2023-04785

Crime Classification: Perjury 

Date/Time of Incident: April 17, 2023 / 10:30 AM

Location: Superior Court of Hartford County, 95 Washington St, Hartford, CT 06106

Summary of Incident:
On the morning of April 17th, Judge Maria Gonzalez was presiding over the high-profile trial of alleged mob boss Antonio "Tony Meatballs" Parisi. The prosecution's star witness, former Parisi underboss Vito Delgado, took the stand to testify against his former boss.

During questioning by the prosecutor, Delgado described in detail his decades-long involvement in the Parisi crime family's racketeering, extortion, and money laundering operations under Tony Parisi's leadership. However, under cross-examination by the defense attorney, Delgado suddenly recanted his entire testimony.

Delgado claimed that he had fabricated all of his previous statements implicating Parisi in order to secure a favorable plea deal for himself from the prosecution. He stated under oath that Tony Parisi was an upstanding businessman who had never engaged in any illegal activities.

Judge Gonzalez immediately ordered the courtroom cleared and had Delgado detained for perjury and obstruction of justice. Delgado's bizarre reversal and blatant lying under oath were a clear attempt to undermine the prosecution's case against the alleged mobster Parisi.

No physical weapons or tools were used to facilitate the perjury. The sole instrument of the crime was Vito Delgado's own false statements given under oath on the witness stand.

Individuals Involved:
- Vito Delgado (perpetrator) - Formerly high-ranking member of the Parisi crime family turned state's witness. Committed perjury on the stand.
- Antonio "Tony Meatballs" Parisi - Alleged boss of the Parisi crime syndicate, on trial for racketeering charges.
- Judge Maria Gonzalez - Presiding judge over the Parisi trial.

The investigation into Vito Delgado's motivations and potential co-conspirators is ongoing. More charges are likely to be filed related to this obstructing perjury incident.
