POLICE REPORT
Case #2023-0418-07

Crime Type: Burglary
Date of Incident: April 18, 2023
Time of Incident: Approx. 2:15 AM 
Location: 725 Maple Grove Lane, Oakwood

Details of the Incident:
On the morning of April 18th, a call came in to the Oakwood Police Department regarding a reported burglary at 725 Maple Grove Lane, a residential home in a quiet suburban neighborhood.

Upon arriving at the scene, officers found clear signs of a break-in. The perpetrator(s) appeared to have gained access by picking the lock on the back door using common lockpicking tools. There were no signs of forced entry or damage to the door itself.

Once inside, the suspect(s) thoroughly ransacked the home, tossing clothing, furniture, and personal belongings around haphazardly. The victims, a married couple in their mid-60s, were reportedly sleeping upstairs at the time and did not wake until after the intruder(s) had already fled.

According to the victims' statements, several valuable items were stolen including:
- A 72" flat screen TV from the living room
- An Apple MacBook Pro laptop 
- Various pieces of jewelry from the master bedroom
- The victim's purse containing cash, credits cards, and personal ID

Curiously, while searching through the home no weapons appear to have been involved or used to threaten or harm the victims. The intruder(s) likely banked on not being detected while the homeowners slept.

Evidence collected at the scene included several fingerprints, footprints, and other trace evidence which has been sent to the forensics lab for analysis. Neighbors are being interviewed as well to try to establish any suspicious activity or persons seen in the area around the time of the incident.

The total value of the stolen goods is estimated at approximately $7,000. The investigation into identifying the perpetrator(s) is ongoing. Anyone with any information regarding this crime is urged to contact the Oakwood Police Department immediately.
