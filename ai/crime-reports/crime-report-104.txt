Police Report #2023-04178

Date: April 15, 2023
Location: 125 Main St, Oakville 

Reported Crime: Carjacking 

Details of the Incident:

On the evening of April 15th, at approximately 8:45 pm, the victim, John Smith (32), was returning to his vehicle after finishing his shift at Oakville Mall. As he approached his black 2019 Honda Civic in the mall parking lot, two masked assailants emerged from behind a parked van.  

The first suspect, described as a male around 6 feet tall with a muscular build, threatened Mr. Smith with a semi-automatic handgun and demanded the car keys. The second suspect, a male around 5'8" with a slimmer build, brandished a large hunting knife menacingly. 

When Mr. Smith hesitated, the suspect with the gun pistol-whipped him across the face, causing a deep laceration above his left eye. Fearing for his life, Mr. Smith complied and handed over the keys. 

The two suspects then forcibly pulled Mr. Smith away from the vehicle. The first suspect entered the driver's side while the second took the passenger seat. They sped out of the parking lot, nearly striking two pedestrians in their haste to escape.

Witnesses reported hearing tires squealing and spotted the black Honda Civic heading south on Main Street at high speeds. The vehicle has not yet been recovered.

Mr. Smith was treated at the scene by paramedics for his head injury before being transported to Oakville General Hospital. His current condition is stable.

The investigation is still ongoing. Police are canvassing the area for any available surveillance footage and witness statements. Anyone with information about this violent carjacking is urged to contact the Oakville Police Department immediately.
