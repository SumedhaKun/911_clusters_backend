Crime: Armed Robbery 

On April 17th, 2023, at approximately 10:15 PM, a call came in to the police dispatch center reporting an armed robbery in progress at the First National Bank branch on Main Street. Officers were immediately dispatched to the scene.

Upon arrival, officers found the bank's front door had been forced open. Inside, three masked suspects dressed in black clothing were holding staff and customers at gunpoint. The suspects were brandishing semi-automatic pistols and screaming threats while forcing the bank manager to open the vault.

One of the suspects, described as a male around 6 feet tall with a muscular build, pistol-whipped a bank teller who was not cooperating fast enough. The teller sustained a laceration to the head and was treated at the scene by paramedics before being transported to Central Hospital. 

After emptying the vault of an undisclosed amount of cash, the suspects gathered up cell phones from the hostages and destroyed the bank's security camera system before fleeing out the front door. Witnesses reported seeing the suspects get into a dark colored sedan and speed off westbound on Main Street.

A county-wide alert was issued for the suspects' vehicle. Roadblocks were set up on major highways but the suspects managed to escape. Evidence recovered at the scene, including DNA from discarded food wrappers and tire impressions, has been sent to the crime lab for analysis.

The robbery is being investigated by the FBI's Violent Crimes Task Force. Authorities are offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to the identification and arrest of the suspects, who are considered armed and extremely dangerous. Anyone with information is urged to contact the FBI tipline immediately.
