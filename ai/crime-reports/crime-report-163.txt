John Roberts

Summary of Incident:
On 04/15/2023 at approximately 10:45 AM, the victim John Roberts reported an extortion attempt against him. Roberts stated that around 9 AM, he received a phone call from a blocked number. The male caller, with a disguised voice, identified himself only as "Mr. Black" and threatened to harm Roberts' wife and young daughter if he did not pay $50,000 within 48 hours.  

"Mr. Black" claimed to have been watching Roberts' family for weeks and provided disturbingly accurate details about their daily routines, routines only someone who had been surveilling them would know. He described what clothes Roberts' wife wore to work on specific days and the times she left in the morning. He also mentioned Roberts' 6-year-old daughter's name and the playground equipment she favors at the local park.  

The caller warned that if Roberts went to the police, his family members would be hunted down and assaulted. "Mr. Black" instructed Roberts to get $50,000 in cash from his bank, put it in a duffel bag, and await further instructions via text message on where to deliver the money. 

Roberts is unsure if the threats are credible but was visibly shaken. He declined sharing the extortion demand with his wife out of fear for her safety. The suspect did not make any additional demands and no money has been exchanged at this point.  

Follow-Up Investigation:
- Attempt to trace the phone number used to make the threats
- Review any footage from nearby security cameras for suspicious activity
- Interview neighbors about any unfamiliar person(s) seen around the victim's residence
- Coordinate safety plans for protecting the victim's family members
