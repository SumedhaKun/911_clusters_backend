POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case #2023-67493

Nature of Crime: Identity Theft 

Date/Time Reported: 04/15/2023 @ 10:32 AM

Location of Occurrence: Unknown (Cybercrime)

On the morning of April 15th, 2023, the Cyber Crimes Division received a complaint from Mrs. Jane Doe, a 38-year-old resident of 124 Maple Street. Mrs. Doe reported that her identity had been stolen and used to open up multiple lines of credit at various financial institutions across the city. 

Upon initial investigation, detectives uncovered that an unknown perpetrator had illegally gained access to a consumer database owned by HyperCore Solutions LLC, a data analytics company. Malware was deployed to infiltrate HyperCore's systems, extracting personal information on thousands of individuals including Mrs. Doe.

The hacked database contained names, dates of birth, social security numbers, addresses, phone numbers and other sensitive data ripe for identity theft and fraud. No signs of physical forced entry were present, as the crime was committed remotely via cyber attack.

With Mrs. Doe's stolen identity, the perpetrator opened credit card accounts, applied for loans, redirected billing statements and made significant fraudulent purchases totaling over $75,000 across a two-month period. The illicit funds were quickly siphoned off through complex blockchain transactions, leaving little financial trail.

No firearms or weapons were utilized during the cyber intrusion. The unidentified hacker relied solely on sophisticated malware to illegally access HyperCore's consumer records database. The breach has since been contained, but the investigation is still active to identify potential co-conspirators.  

Mrs. Doe has retained counsel and is working with her creditors to recover losses and restore her credit standing. HyperCore Solutions may face civil penalties for negligent security practices. Additional identities and fraudulent activities linked to the data breach are still being uncovered.

The Cyber Crimes Division, along with state and federal agencies, are continuing to analyze digital forensics to pinpoint the origin of the attack and potentially apprehend the criminal hacker(s) responsible. All citizens are warned to remain vigilant in protecting their personal data from identity thieves operating in the online world.
