POLICE REPORT
Case No: 2023-04152

Date of Incident: April 15, 2023
Time of Incident: Approximately 10:15 PM 
Location: Main Street Jewelers, 215 Main St, Anytown USA

INCIDENT SUMMARY:
On the evening of April 15th, 2023, a daring armed robbery took place at Main Street Jewelers in the downtown area. Two suspects, described as males in their late 20s or early 30s, gained entry to the store by smashing the front glass door with the butts of their handguns. 

The suspects, wearing dark clothing and ski masks to conceal their identities, immediately drew their semi-automatic handguns and ordered the three employees and one customer to the ground. One suspect, referred to as Suspect #1, kept his weapon trained on the victims while issuing threats of violence if they did not cooperate. The other suspect, Suspect #2, proceeded to smash several glass jewelry cases with the butt of his gun to access the high-end merchandise inside.

After clearing out numerous trays of diamond rings, luxury watches, and other valuable jewelry items into a large duffel bag, the suspects backed towards the shattered door while maintaining their weapons pointed at the victims. Prior to fleeing, Suspect #1 pistol whipped the store manager across the face, causing a severe laceration, in what appeared to be an attempt to discourage the manager from raising an alarm immediately. 

The suspects were last seen fleeing westbound on Main Street in a late model black sedan, estimated to be a Ford Taurus or similar vehicle. The total value of the stolen merchandise is still being calculated but is expected to exceed $500,000. The manager was treated at the scene by paramedics for the laceration to his face.

EVIDENCE RECOVERED:
- Several ski mask fibers collected from the scene
- Shattered glass from the broken door and jewelry cases
- One .40 caliber semi-automatic pistol casing located near the door
- Partial shoe prints from the suspects tracked in the spilled jewelry case debris

The investigation is ongoing and anyone with information about this violent robbery is urged to contact the Anytown Police Department immediately.

End of report.
