POLICE REPORT

Incident Type: Stalking, Harassment 
Date/Time: April 17th, 2023 - 9:30pm
Location: 825 Oak Street, Apartment 4B

Summary of Incident:
The victim, Sarah Wilkins (28), reported an incident of persistent stalking and harassment by an unknown male suspect. Miss Wilkins stated that over the past three weeks, she has been subjected to escalating behavior that has caused her to fear for her safety.

The suspect first gained access to the victim's personal information through unknown means, potentially involving social engineering tactics to compromise online accounts and data sources. He then used this information to track the victim's daily routines and movements.

Miss Wilkins reported that the suspect began leaving handwritten notes at her apartment building and vehicle, expressing an unhealthy obsession and making vague threats. He also repeatedly called and sent explicit text messages from various blocked numbers. The victim recognized the suspect's voice from a previous unwanted encounter but does not know his true identity.

On April 15th, the suspect attempted to gain physical access to the victim's secured apartment building by following another resident inside. Building security footage shows the suspect lingering in the lobby for several hours before being asked to leave by building staff. 

Two days later, on April 17th, Miss Wilkins discovered that her apartment had been illegally entered while she was at work. Her laptop and personal belongings had been rummaged through, and strands of hair not belonging to her were found on her bed. No valuables were taken, suggesting the intent was to violate her privacy and instill fear. The suspect likely used lock picking tools to bypass the apartment's security measures.

No weapons were identified as being involved in this crime at this point. However, the level of harassment, invasion of privacy, and intimidation tactics used by the suspect have left the victim in a sustained state of fear and anxiety.

The investigation is ongoing as law enforcement attempts to identify the suspect and put a stop to his dangerous fixation before the situation potentially escalates further.
