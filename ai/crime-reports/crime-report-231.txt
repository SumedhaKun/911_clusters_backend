POLICE REPORT
Case #: 2023-04-16-CYBER-012

Crime Type: Cybercrimes
Location: [REDACTED] Corporation, Global Headquarters

On April 16th, 2023 at approximately 9:15 AM, the cybersecurity team at [REDACTED] Corporation detected suspicious network activity originating from an unknown source. Further investigation revealed that an unauthorized party had gained access to the company's internal systems through a previously unknown vulnerability. 

The perpetrator(s) are believed to have used sophisticated malware and targeted phishing techniques to infiltrate the network and establish a backdoor for continued access. Once inside, the attacker(s) deployed cyber attacks against critical systems and infrastructure with the goal of data exfiltration and service disruption.

No physical weapons or direct physical force was used in the commission of this crime. However, the cyber attacks launched caused significant damage by encrypting data stores, deleting logs, and implanting additional malware. Core operations ground to a halt as the incident response team worked to contain the breach.

Forensic analysis is ongoing, but the following facts are known:

- Multiple employees reported receiving emails impersonating trusted parties with links that deployed credential-stealing malware when clicked.
- A zero-day vulnerability in a widely used enterprise software suite was exploited, allowing lateral movement across the network.
- Proprietary source code repositories were accessed and exfiltrated by the attacker(s).
- Ransomware was deployed across file servers, encrypting terabytes of data.

The attack appears to be financially motivated, with the threat actor(s) demanding a ransom payment of $25 million in cryptocurrency to avoid public release of the stolen data. The company is working with third-party cybersecurity incident responders and law enforcement as the investigation continues.

No individuals were physically harmed during the incident. However, the breach has caused severe operational disruption and financial damages estimated in the tens of millions of dollars.

Witnesses are asked to contact the Cybercrime Division with any information that may aid in identifying and apprehending the perpetrator(s).
