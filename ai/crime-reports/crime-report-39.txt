POLICE REPORT

Case Number: 2023-04-567
Crime: Embezzlement

Summary of Incident:
On April 12th, 2023, the financial crimes division received a complaint from the accounting department at TechSolutions Inc. regarding suspicious financial transactions. An internal audit revealed that over $3 million had been misappropriated from the company's accounts over the past 18 months.

The suspect is Jane Smith, a long-time accounts payable clerk at TechSolutions. Smith had abused her access to the company's financial systems and funds to illegally transfer money into her personal offshore accounts.

Investigation:
Interviews with Smith's co-workers and a forensic analysis of her computer revealed a complex embezzlement scheme. Smith had created fake vendor accounts and invoices, approving payments to these shell companies which were actually just re-routing money to her own accounts in the Cayman Islands.

Smith was highly skilled with accounting software and exploited security vulnerabilities to override approval requirements. She covered her tracks by deleting logs and altering records to match the fraudulent transactions.

No weapons or force were used in the commission of this crime, as Smith's position granted her authorized access and ability to manipulate the financial systems remotely from her computer workstation.

Evidence:
- Accounting discrepancies totaling $3,124,572 in misappropriated funds
- Computer forensics found modified log files and audit trails
- Offshore bank accounts in suspect's name receiving fraudulent payments
- Invoices and accounting entries for shell vendor companies

The suspect Jane Smith has been arrested and charges of embezzlement, fraud, and money laundering are pending. TechSolutions is pursuing civil litigation to attempt to recover the stolen funds.

This case highlights the need for enhanced security monitoring, segregation of duties, and robust auditing controls - especially for employees with financial system access privileges.
