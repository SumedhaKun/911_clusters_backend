Nature of Incident: Motor Vehicle Theft  

Date/Time Occurred: April 12, 2023 at approximately 2:15 AM

Location: 125 Oak Street, residential neighborhood

Summary of Incident:
On the morning of April 12th, officers responded to a report of a motor vehicle theft that occurred overnight on Oak Street. The victim, John Smith (34), stated that he parked his 2018 Honda Civic in his driveway at approximately 10 PM the previous night. 

When Mr. Smith went to leave for work at 7 AM, he discovered the vehicle was missing from the driveway. He immediately called the police to report the theft. Officers processed the scene and found evidence that the perpetrator(s) used a screwdriver to gain entry into the vehicle by punching the driver's side door lock.

Once inside, the screwdriver was used to hotwire the ignition and steal the vehicle. Neighbors did not report hearing or seeing any suspicious activity overnight. Evidence at the scene indicates that some physical force was likely used to break into the vehicle, but no other weapons appear to have been involved.  

The vehicle is still outstanding at this time. The stolen Honda has a California license plate of 8XY2P91. It is a blue four-door sedan. Any person with information about this incident or the location of the stolen vehicle is urged to contact the police department immediately.
