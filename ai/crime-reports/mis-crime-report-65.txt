Details of the Incident:

On the morning of July 18th at approximately 2:45 AM, a home invasion and robbery occurred at the residence of the Johnson family located at 428 Maple Grove Lane. The perpetrator(s) gained entry by picking the lock on the front door, a common tool used to access secure locations.

Once inside, the suspect(s) proceeded upstairs to the master bedroom where the victims, Robert and Karen Johnson, were asleep. The suspect(s) used physical force by restraining the victims with zip ties. A knife was brandished as the weapon used in the crime to further control and intimidate the victims. 

The suspect(s) demanded that the Johnsons open their home safe and turn over any cash, jewelry, and valuables inside. In a state of fear, the victims complied with the demands. The suspect(s) made off with approximately $25,000 in cash, a Rolex watch valued at $12,000, diamond tennis bracelet worth $18,000, and a handful of other precious jewelry items.  

The suspect(s) then exited out the back door, leaving the Johnsons bound but unharmed physically. Neighbors reported hearing loud banging noises around 3:00 AM, likely when the suspect(s) were entering or leaving the premises. However, no witnesses were able to provide descriptions of the perpetrators.

Evidence collected at the scene included numerous unidentified fingerprints, the damaged front door lock, and the zip ties used to restrain the victims. The Johnson home security system was disarmed during the invasion.

The investigation is ongoing as law enforcement attempts to identify the suspect(s) involved in this high-value residential robbery. Residents in the area are urged to review any home security footage and report any suspicious activity.
