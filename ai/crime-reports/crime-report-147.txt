Nature of Incident: Robbery 

Date/Time of Incident: April 17, 2023 / 10:30 PM

Location: Main Street Convenience Store, 548 Main St.

Victim: John Roberts (clerk on duty)

On the evening of April 17th, a robbery occurred at the Main Street Convenience Store located at 548 Main Street. According to the victim, John Roberts, who was working as the clerk on duty, the incident unfolded as follows:

At approximately 10:25 PM, a male suspect entered the convenience store through the unlocked front door. The suspect, described as a Caucasian male in his mid-30s, approximately 6 feet tall with a slim build, was wearing a black hoodie, blue jeans, and a baseball cap. 

Upon entering, the suspect immediately approached the counter where Roberts was stationed. The suspect then brandished a semi-automatic handgun and pointed it directly at Roberts, demanding that he open the cash register and hand over all the money inside.

Roberts, fearing for his life, complied with the suspect's demands. The suspect did not use any tools to access the secure location, as the front door was unlocked at the time.

With the gun still pointed at Roberts, the suspect reached over the counter and emptied the cash register of all its contents, taking an estimated $500 in cash. Throughout the incident, the suspect used intimidation tactics and verbal threats, warning Roberts not to attempt anything or he would be shot.

After obtaining the money, the suspect backed away from the counter while still holding the gun pointed at Roberts. He then fled the scene on foot, running out the front door and heading westbound on Main Street.

Roberts immediately called 911 to report the robbery. Police units were dispatched to the scene, but the suspect remains at large.

No injuries were reported during the incident.

Evidence collected at the scene includes surveillance footage from the store's security cameras and potential fingerprints left behind on the counter.

The investigation into this armed robbery is ongoing. Anyone with information regarding the identity or whereabouts of the suspect is urged to contact the police department's tip line immediately.
