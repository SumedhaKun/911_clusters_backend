Location: 525 Oak Street, Apartment 3B, Riverton

Victim(s): Jane Smith, 28-year-old female resident

Summary of Incident:
On the morning of April 12th, the Riverton Police Department received a call from the victim, Jane Smith, reporting a burglary at her apartment overnight. Upon arrival, officers found signs of forced entry through the front door.

The perpetrator(s) gained access to the victim's apartment through physical presence and skilled lock picking. Based on evidence at the scene, it appears that a lock pick gun or rake pick was likely used to manipulate the lock tumblers and bypass the deadbolt lock.

Once inside, the burglar(s) ransacked the apartment, overturning furniture and stealing a laptop computer, jewelry box, and the victim's wallet containing cash and credit cards. The total value of the stolen goods is estimated at $4,200.

The victim, who was home asleep at the time, reported being awoken by loud noises from the living room area around 2:15 AM. Upon investigating, she was confronted by a masked intruder wielding what appeared to be a crowbar or tire iron. The suspect threatened the use of force against the victim if she did not comply.

Fearing for her safety, the victim retreated to her bedroom and locked herself inside until she heard the perpetrator depart through the front entrance around 2:45 AM. No physical injuries were reported by the victim.

Evidence collected at the crime scene includes:
- Pry marks on the front door frame and lock area
- Shoeprints (size 10-11) near point of entry
- Fibers (dark blue cotton) collected from the living room carpet

Canvassing of the neighborhood is underway, and a request has been issued for any residents with security camera footage of the area between 1:30-3:30 AM.

The investigation is ongoing. Anyone with information about this crime is urged to contact the Riverton Police Department's Burglary Unit at (555) 346-9871.
