Incident: Homicide 

On April 15th, 2023 at approximately 11:30 PM, officers responded to a call of a reported home invasion and assault at 215 Oak Tree Lane. Upon arrival, officers discovered the body of the homeowner, 45-year-old John Williams, lying in a pool of blood in the kitchen area. 

The scene was immediately secured, and the coroner was called to the residence. Based on the condition of the body and evidence collected, it appears that Mr. Williams sustained multiple stab wounds, which were determined to be the cause of death.

Through the investigation, it was discovered that the perpetrator(s) gained entry into the home by using a crowbar to force open a ground-level window in the rear of the residence. Once inside, the suspect(s) encountered Mr. Williams and a violent struggle ensued, resulting in the deadly stabbing. 

Bloody shoeprints and the crowbar used for entry were collected as evidence from the scene. Additionally, the murder weapon, a standard 8-inch kitchen knife, was recovered near the victim's body. Forensics teams also identified defensive wounds on the victim's hands and arms, indicating he fought against his attacker(s).

At this time, the motive is unclear, and no suspects have been named. However, the investigation remains active, and officers are exploring all leads. Increased patrol has been implemented in the neighborhood as a precautionary measure.

Anyone with information regarding this incident is urged to contact the police department's tip line immediately.
