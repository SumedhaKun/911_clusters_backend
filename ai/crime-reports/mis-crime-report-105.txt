INCIDENT REPORT
Case #: 2023-04601
Date: April 12, 2023
Time: 2:17 AM 

Crime Type: Home Invasion/Robbery

On the night of April 12th at approximately 2:17 AM, officers responded to a 911 call reporting a home invasion robbery at 215 Oak Tree Lane. Upon arrival, officers found the front door kicked in and the homeowners, John and Jane Doe, visibly shaken.

According to the victims' statements, they were awoken by loud banging noises coming from the front of their residence. Two masked individuals then forcibly entered through the front door by kicking it open. 

Modes of Accessing Victims:
The suspects gained entry by kicking in the front door. Once inside, they threatened the victims at knifepoint and struck Mr. Doe with a blunt object, rendering him unconscious.

Common Tools Used:
Evidence at the scene indicated the suspects likely used a crowbar or similar tool to pry open the front door initially before resorting to kicking it in.

Type of Force Used:
The suspects employed physical force by kicking in the door and striking Mr. Doe. They also used threats of violence by menacing the victims with a knife.

Weapons Used:
- Knife
- Blunt object (likely a baseball bat or crowbar based on evidence)

After subduing Mr. Doe, the suspects bound Mrs. Doe's hands and feet while ransacking the residence. Valuable jewelry, electronics, and cash were taken during the robbery. The suspects then fled the scene on foot.

Mrs. Doe was able to free herself and call 911 once the suspects had left. Her husband regained consciousness but sustained a concussion from the blunt force trauma. Both victims were shaken but received only minor injuries.

The investigation is still ongoing as forensic evidence is processed. Neighbors have been canvassed for any information, and a search was conducted but no suspects have been apprehended yet. Police are reviewing home security footage from nearby residences.

This was an especially brazen and violent crime. The suspects clearly cased the residence beforehand and came prepared with weapons. Their willingness to use extreme force is very concerning. All residents are advised to keep doors and windows secured, be alert, and report any suspicious activity immediately.
