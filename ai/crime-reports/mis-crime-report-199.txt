POLICE REPORT
Case #: 2023-04-17-CYBER

Crime Type: Cyber Crime, Unlawful Access to Computer Systems

On April 17th, 2023 at approximately 2:15 AM, the Cyber Crimes Unit received an alert from the security team at CapitalOne Bank regarding a potential data breach. Upon further investigation, it was discovered that an unknown perpetrator had gained unauthorized access to the bank's secure computer systems.

The perpetrator appeared to utilize sophisticated computer software and hacking tools to bypass the bank's cyber defenses. Based on the digital forensic evidence collected, the tools used seem to be a customized malware program capable of exploiting previously unknown vulnerabilities in the bank's network architecture.

No physical force or weapons were used to access the systems, as the attack was carried out remotely via the internet. However, the perpetrator did employ brute force methods such as credential stuffing and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks to overwhelm the bank's login servers and security protocols.

Once inside the network, the perpetrator managed to escalate their privileges and move laterally, ultimately gaining access to highly sensitive customer data including names, addresses, social security numbers, account details and transaction histories of over 8 million customers.

The cyber criminal's motives are still under investigation, but preliminary analysis indicates the data breach may have been carried out for financial gain, with the intention to sell the stolen customer records on dark web marketplaces or potentially use the information for identity theft, fraud and other illicit activities.

The Cyber Crimes Unit is working closely with federal agencies and cybersecurity firms to analyze the malware signatures, identify the perpetrator(s) and their location, and implement measures to prevent similar attacks in the future.

This remains an active and ongoing investigation. Anyone with information relevant to this case is urged to contact the Cyber Crimes Hotline immediately.
