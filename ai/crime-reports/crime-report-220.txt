Police Report #2023-04718
Crime: Arson 

On the night of May 15th, 2023, the Centerville Fire Department received multiple calls around 2:30am reporting a large fire at Sawyer's Warehouse on Industrial Blvd. Upon arrival, firefighters encountered a raging inferno engulfing the large warehouse facility. 

After managing to get the flames under control several hours later, arson investigators were called to the scene. Their initial inspection found evidence that the fire was intentionally set at multiple points inside the warehouse. Security camera footage revealed that around 1:45am, a hooded suspect used bolt cutters to breach the perimeter fence and gain access to the property.

The suspect, dressed in dark clothing, was seen entering through a rear door they forced open. About 15 minutes later, multiple fires were visible starting in different areas of the warehouse simultaneously. The suspect was captured on camera fleeing the scene shortly after the flames began to spread rapidly.

Accelerant detection dogs were brought in and confirmed the presence of gasoline across several areas of the warehouse's interior. Matches and empty gas canisters were found as well, indicating the suspect used gasoline to start the fires and matches as an ignition source.

The warehouse, which was used to store industrial equipment and supplies, was completely destroyed by the fire. Estimated damages are currently around $3.5 million in property loss and equipment. Thankfully, no injuries were reported as the facility was unoccupied at the time of the incident.  

Police are still investigating for potential motives and any leads on the identity of the suspect. Arson is considered a violent crime, and the person responsible could face severe penalties including years in prison if apprehended and convicted. Anyone with any information is urged to contact the Centerville Police Department immediately.
