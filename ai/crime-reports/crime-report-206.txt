POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case #2023-04187

Nature of Incident: Burglary 

Date/Time of Incident: April 17, 2023 / Between 8:30 PM - 11:45 PM

Location: 415 Oak Tree Lane, Oakwood

Victim(s): James and Lily Potter, residents 

On the evening of April 17th, the Potter residents reported a burglary that occurred at their home sometime between 8:30 PM and 11:45 PM while they were out for dinner. Upon returning home at approximately 11:50 PM, they immediately noticed signs of a forced entry.

The perpetrator(s) appeared to have gained access by breaking the glass on one of the ground floor windows at the rear of the home. Evidence at the scene indicated the use of a blunt tool, likely a crowbar or hammer, to shatter the window glass. Markings on the window frame suggest the intruder then cleared any remaining shards and opened the window to climb through.

Once inside, the burglar(s) seemingly moved through the first floor, rifling through drawers, closets, and other storage areas. The master bedroom appeared particularly disturbed, with a jewelry box and various valuables strewn about. Lacking any evidence of a violent encounter, it is presumed the home was unoccupied at the time of the incident.

No security alarm had been activated during the burglary. Curiously, while highly valuable items like televisions and computers remained untouched, various smaller valuables like jewelry, cash, and portable electronics appeared to have been taken. The total value of the stolen goods is still being assessed by the victims.

The perpetrator(s) seemed to have made their escape through the same broken window, leaving behind tell-tale signs like scuffmarks and disturbed foliage outside. Samples of potential evidence like shoeprints, hair, and fabric fibers have been collected from both the interior and exterior of the premises.  

At this time, there are no credible leads or suspects identified. Neighbors did not report any suspicious activity or unfamiliar vehicles in the area that evening. The investigation is ongoing as police process any available forensic evidence and review any potentially relevant surveillance footage from the vicinity.

Reporting Officer: Det. John Blake, Badge #7418
