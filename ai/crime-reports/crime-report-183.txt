POLICE REPORT
Case #: 2023-0418
Crime: Witness Tampering

On April 15th, 2023, the Riverton Police Department received a complaint from Mrs. Jane Doe regarding an alleged case of witness tampering related to an upcoming trial. According to Mrs. Doe, she was approached by an unidentified individual while leaving the courthouse after attending a pre-trial hearing in the case of State v. John Smith.

Mrs. Doe stated that as she was walking to her vehicle, a man approached her from behind and grabbed her arm in a forceful manner. The man, described as being approximately 6 feet tall with a muscular build and wearing a dark hooded sweatshirt, warned Mrs. Doe against testifying in the upcoming trial. "If you know what's good for you, you'll keep your mouth shut in that courtroom," the man allegedly told her in a threatening tone.

The suspect then proceeded to make veiled threats about potential consequences for Mrs. Doe and her family if she chose to take the stand and provide testimony. Fearing for her safety, Mrs. Doe did not attempt to resist or further engage with the suspect, who quickly fled the scene on foot.

Upon returning home, Mrs. Doe immediately contacted the police department to report the incident. Officers were dispatched to her residence to take an official statement and collect any potential evidence. Unfortunately, the suspect did not leave behind any physical evidence or surveillance footage from the area could be recovered.

Based on Mrs. Doe's statement and the alleged actions of the unidentified individual, the police department has opened an investigation into this matter as a case of witness tampering. Detectives will be working to identify the suspect and determine if there are any connections to the upcoming State v. Smith trial or the individuals involved.

Witness tampering is a serious offense that undermines the integrity of the judicial system. The Riverton Police Department is committed to thoroughly investigating this incident and ensuring that all witnesses feel safe in carrying out their civic duty to testify truthfully in court proceedings.

The investigation remains ongoing at this time. Anyone with information related to this case is urged to contact the Riverton Police Department immediately.
