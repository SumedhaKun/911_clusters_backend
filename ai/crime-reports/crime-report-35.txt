POLICE INCIDENT REPORT

Case Number: 2023-04137
Incident Type: Assault
Date/Time: April 21, 2023 / 11:45 PM 
Location: O'Riley's Bar & Grill, 225 Main Street

SUMMARY OF INCIDENT:
On the evening of April 21st, officers responded to a report of an assault at O'Riley's Bar & Grill in downtown. Upon arrival, officers found the victim, John Smith (28), lying on the floor with visible injuries to his face and torso.

According to witness statements, the suspect, described as a white male approximately 6' tall with a muscular build and short brown hair, had approached Smith at the bar earlier in the evening. An argument ensued between the two men, though the origin of the dispute remains unclear. 

The suspect then suddenly attacked Smith, punching him repeatedly in the face before kicking him multiple times in the ribs as he fell to the ground. Witnesses state the suspect was wearing knuckle dusters during the assault, likely accounting for the severe lacerations on Smith's face.

Bar staff attempted to intervene and pull the suspect off Smith, but he was able to break free and flee the scene on foot before police arrived. Security footage from the bar has been obtained and is being reviewed to identify the suspect.

Smith was transported to Memorial Hospital where he was treated for a broken nose, orbital fracture, three cracked ribs, and multiple lacerations requiring stitches. He is listed in stable condition.

No forced entry or tools were utilized in this incident, as the suspect was already inside the bar as a patron when the assault occurred.

The investigation is ongoing as police search for the unidentified suspect. Anyone with information about this incident is urged to contact Detective J. Harris at 555-0176.
