POLICE INCIDENT REPORT

Case Number: 2023-0416-7845

Crime: Embezzlement

Date/Time Reported: 4/16/2023 10:32 AM  
Location: Acme Financial Services, 125 Main St

Reported By: John Smith, CFO of Acme Financial Services

Details of Incident:

On April 12th, 2023, it was discovered that a large sum of money had been embezzled from Acme Financial Services by a trusted employee over the course of several years. The suspect, Jane Doe, had been working as the head accountant at the firm for over a decade.

Through a forensic audit, it was determined that Doe had been systematically skimming funds from client accounts and manipulating the bookkeeping records to cover her tracks. The total amount embezzled is estimated to be over $3.2 million.

Doe utilized her high-level access privileges and knowledge of the firm's accounting systems to bypass security protocols. She created fake vendor accounts and recorded fraudulent payments to those accounts, which she would then redirect to her own offshore bank accounts.

Further investigation uncovered that Doe had obtained secure login credentials through social engineering techniques, tricking other employees into divulging sensitive information. She also exploited vulnerabilities in outdated software to gain elevated access.

When confronted, Doe confessed to the crimes, stating that she had fallen into debt after a gambling addiction and saw the embezzlement as an easy way out. No weapons or force were used in the commission of these crimes.

The suspect is currently in custody awaiting trial for embezzlement, money laundering, computer fraud, and other related charges. Restitution is being sought to recover the stolen funds.
