POLICE INCIDENT REPORT 

Case No: 2023-07182
Date: April 15, 2023
Nature of Crime: Burglary, Grand Theft Auto

On April 15th at approximately 2:15 AM, officers responded to a residential burglary in progress at 347 Maple Lane. Upon arrival, officers observed a broken window on the east side of the residence and an unoccupied 2019 Ford Mustang running in the driveway with the driver's side door open. 

The homeowners, John and Jane Smith, reported being awoken by the sound of shattering glass. Mr. Smith went to investigate and encountered two masked intruders inside their home. The suspects immediately fled through the broken window into the driveway.

Evidence at the scene indicated the suspects gained entry by using a screwdriver to jimmy the lock on a ground floor window. Once inside, the suspects stole a laptop, jewelry box, and Mr. Smith's car keys from the kitchen counter. 

The suspects then used hot-wiring tools to start Mr. Smith's Ford Mustang, likely intending to use it as a getaway vehicle. However, they were startled by Mr. Smith's presence and aborted their plan, fleeing on foot instead. No weapons were brandished during the crime.

Forensics recovered a blood sample from the shattered window frame, suggesting one of the suspects may have sustained lacerations during the break-in. The blood is being processed for DNA evidence. 

Neighbors reported hearing tires squealing around the time of the incident, but did not witness any vehicles leaving the area. The suspects remain at large and the investigation is ongoing. Residents are advised to keep all doors and windows locked, and to report any suspicious activity immediately.
