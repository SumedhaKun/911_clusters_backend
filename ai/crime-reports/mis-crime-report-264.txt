POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case #2023-04618

Reported Crime: Aggravated Burglary 

Summary:
On April 16th, 2023 at approximately 2:30 AM, officers responded to a residential burglary in progress at 415 Oak Tree Lane. The homeowners, John and Emily Davidson, were awoken by loud noises coming from the first floor of their home. Mr. Davidson went to investigate and was immediately confronted by three male suspects who had gained entry by smashing the rear patio door with a crowbar.

The suspects physically assaulted Mr. Davidson, striking him repeatedly with their fists and the crowbar they had used to access the home. Mrs. Davidson attempted to call 911 but one of the suspects brandished a 9mm semiautomatic handgun and threatened to shoot her if she didn't remain quiet. 

The suspects proceeded to bind the Davidson's hands and feet with zip ties. They spent approximately 45 minutes ransacking the home, stealing jewelry, cash, electronics and other valuables before fleeing in a dark colored SUV. 

Mr. Davidson sustained a concussion, multiple lacerations and a broken arm from the physical assault. He was transported to Mercy General Hospital for treatment. Mrs. Davidson was unharmed physically but extremely shaken by the incident.

Evidence:
- Shoeprints and tool marks on shattered patio door
- Zip ties used to restrain victims
- Witnesses reporting seeing a dark SUV speeding away
- Potential security camera footage from neighbors

The suspects are still at large and should be considered armed and extremely dangerous. Anyone with information is urged to contact detectives immediately.
