Police Report #2023-04718

Incident Type: Burglary
Date/Time: April 12, 2023 / 2:17 AM  
Location: 215 Oak Tree Lane, Oakwood

On April 12th at approximately 2:17 AM, officers responded to a call reporting a burglary in progress at the residential home of John and Jane Smith located at 215 Oak Tree Lane. Upon arrival, officers found signs of forced entry through a rear window on the ground floor of the home.

The suspect(s) appeared to have used lock picking tools to bypass the window lock, allowing them to slide open the window and gain access to the home. Based on evidence at the scene, it seems the suspect(s) did not use any weapons during the commission of the crime. However, physical force was likely used to open the jammed window after picking the lock.

Once inside, the suspect(s) ransacked the main floor of the home, stealing a variety of valuables including jewelry, cash, electronics, and other small valuables. The total value of items stolen is currently estimated at $27,500. 

Fortunately, the homeowners were not present during the burglary as they were out of town visiting relatives. The suspect(s) were long gone by the time the neighbors called 911 after noticing the open window and signs of a break-in.

Evidence technicians responded to the scene and conducted a thorough investigation, collecting potential DNA samples and fingerprints. However, no suspects have been identified or apprehended at this time. 

The burglary remains an open investigation as detectives continue pursuing any leads. Anyone with information about this incident is urged to contact the Oakwood Police Department immediately.
