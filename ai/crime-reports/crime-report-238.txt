Case Number: 2023-0416-784

Date of Incident: April 16, 2023 
Time of Incident: Approximately 2:30 AM
Location: 175 Maple Drive, Oakwood

Nature of Crime: Violent Home Invasion 

SUMMARY OF INCIDENT:
On April 16th at around 2:30 AM, the Oakwood Police Department received a frantic 911 call from a resident at 175 Maple Drive reporting a violent home invasion in progress. Officers were dispatched to the scene immediately. 

Upon arrival, police found evidence that the front door had been forcibly kicked in, with the door frame splintered and the lock mechanism completely broken. Inside the residence, officers encountered a gruesome and chaotic scene. 

The victims, John and Mary Roberts, an elderly couple in their 70s, had sustained serious injuries from an apparent assault. Mrs. Roberts was found unconscious in the hallway with severe lacerations and blunt force trauma. Mr. Roberts was located in the living room, bound with duct tape and badly beaten. Both victims were transported to Oakwood General Hospital in critical condition.

Evidence at the scene indicates that the suspect(s) broke into the home by kicking in the front door with extreme force. Once inside, they carried out a vicious attack on the residents, likely to subdue them during the commission of a robbery or other felony. A bloodstained kitchen knife was recovered, believed to be the weapon used to inflict the lacerations on Mrs. Roberts.

The suspect(s) made off with an undetermined amount of valuables and cash after ransacking the premises. Neighbors reported hearing shouting and a commotion around 2:15 AM but did not witness the perpetrators.  

The investigation is still active and ongoing. Police are canvassing the area and reviewing any available surveillance footage in hopes of identifying the suspect(s) involved in this violent home invasion and brutal assault. Residents are urged to keep their doors and windows locked and to report any suspicious activity immediately.
