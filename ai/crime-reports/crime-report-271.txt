Here is a detailed police report for a cybercrime case:

POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case #: 2023-04281
Date: May 12, 2023

INCIDENT DETAILS:
On the morning of May 11th, the corporate headquarters of TechXYZ reported a major cybersecurity breach and data theft. According to the company's Chief Information Security Officer, unknown cyber criminals were able to infiltrate TechXYZ's secure network and databases through sophisticated malware and malicious code. 

The attack is believed to have begun two weeks prior when an employee fell victim to a phishing email scam, unknowingly allowing the perpetrators to gain a foothold into the system. From there, the criminals deployed custom-built malware to map out TechXYZ's network infrastructure and locate critical data repositories. Using this malware, along with injected viruses, the criminals were able to circumvent security protocols and exfiltrate terabytes of sensitive data, including customer records, financial information, proprietary research, and confidential communications.

No physical force or weapons were utilized in the cyber attack, which took place entirely through remote network access and malicious code execution. However, the financial and reputational damage to TechXYZ is expected to be severe due to the extent of data theft and potential legal ramifications regarding customer privacy violations.  

EVIDENCE COLLECTED:
- Network log files and intrusion detection alerts
- Samples of malware payloads and virus code 
- Phishing email sources and infected employee devices
- Forensic images of compromised servers and databases

ONGOING INVESTIGATION:
The cyber crimes unit is working closely with TechXYZ's internal security team as well as the FBI's cyber crime division to analyze the recovered evidence. Efforts are focused on:

1) Identifying the specific actors or groups behind the attack through code analysis and dark web intelligence.
2) Determining the scope of data theft and potential risks to customers.
3) Hardening security vulnerabilities to prevent future breaches.
4) Pursuing legal actions against the perpetrators through international law enforcement cooperation.

The investigation is still active and ongoing. More information will be provided as it becomes available.
