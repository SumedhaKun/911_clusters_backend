Incident Report #2023-04187

Crime: Armed Robbery 

Date/Time: April 15, 2023 / 11:38 PM

Location: Main Street Convenience Store, 582 Main St. 

Summary of Incident:
On the evening of April 15th, the Main Street Convenience Store was the victim of a brazen armed robbery. According to witness statements and surveillance footage, at approximately 11:35 PM, two masked individuals forced entry into the store brandishing semi-automatic handguns. 

The suspects, dressed in dark clothing and ski masks, used a lock pick gun to quickly bypass the front door's lock. Once inside, one suspect immediately approached the cashier, 28-year-old Jamal Lewis, striking him in the face with the butt of his firearm and demanding he open the cash registers.

The second suspect vaulted over the front counter and used a pry bar to force open the safe located in the back office. After clearing out all available cash from the registers and safe, the suspects fled on foot out the front door. 

Eyewitnesses report seeing the suspects get into a late model black sedan that was idling in the alleyway behind the store with its headlights off before speeding away northbound on Main Street. It's estimated the suspects made off with approximately $7,000 in cash.

Jamal Lewis was treated at the scene by paramedics for a laceration above his left eye but refused further medical treatment. No other employees or customers were present during the robbery.

Investigative Steps:
- Recovered surveillance footage from the store's security cameras
- Processed the scene for fingerprints, DNA, and other physical evidence 
- Canvassed the neighborhood for any additional witnesses
- Obtained search warrants for area traffic cameras to identify suspect vehicle

Suspects are still at large. Anyone with information regarding this incident is urged to contact Detective J. Wilson at 555-0179.
