Summary:
On the morning of April 15th, officers responded to a 911 call reporting a possible home invasion and assault at 625 Maple Grove Lane. Upon arriving at approximately 4:15 AM, officers found the rear door of the residence had been forcibly opened with a crowbar. 

Inside, they discovered the body of the homeowner, 58-year-old Samuel Jacobs, lying in a pool of blood in the upstairs hallway. The victim had sustained multiple stab wounds, and the murder weapon - a large kitchen knife - was found at the scene.

According to evidence and the initial investigation, the perpetrator(s) appears to have entered the home in the early morning hours through the rear door using the crowbar to gain access. Once inside, the suspect(s) encountered Mr. Jacobs and a violent confrontation ensued resulting in the brutal stabbing.

Numerous items were disturbed and valuable belongings were seemingly collected, indicating the crime may have initially been an attempted robbery before turning into a vicious murder. Forensics is processing the scene and canvassing for witnesses, video surveillance, and any other evidence that may aid in identifying the suspect(s).

The victim's wife, who was out of town visiting family, has been notified of the tragedy. The investigation is active and ongoing as detectives work to determine motive and find those responsible for this heinous crime.
