POLICE REPORT 
Case #: 2023-04162
Incident: Armed Robbery

On April 15th, 2023 at approximately 11:30 PM, officers responded to a call regarding an armed robbery at the First National Bank on Main Street. Upon arrival, officers interviewed the bank manager, John Smith, who provided the following details:

According to Mr. Smith, three masked suspects forcibly entered the bank after closing hours by breaching the rear entrance using a thermal lance cutting tool. Surveillance footage shows the suspects were highly organized and moved with a sense of urgency, indicating pre-planning and inside knowledge of the bank's security protocols.

Once inside, the suspects located the vault by disabling the alarm system using a bypass technique commonly employed by professional cyber criminals. They then used a high-powered explosive shaped charge to blow open the vault door. Mr. Smith stated that one suspect stood guard with a semi-automatic firearm while the other two cleaned out the vault of all cash reserves, estimated at over $2 million.

After emptying the vault, the suspects fled out the same entrance, leaving behind spent ammunition casings consistent with 9mm rounds fired from the guard's firearm. Fortunately, no bank employees were present during the incident and there were no injuries reported.  

Forensics teams are currently processing evidence from the scene. Law enforcement is reviewing surveillance footage and following up on leads, but the suspects remain at large and are considered armed and extremely dangerous. The investigation is ongoing.

Anyone with information regarding this incident is urged to contact the police department immediately.
