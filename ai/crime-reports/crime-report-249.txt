Police Report #2023-0415

Incident: Stalking
Date: April 15, 2023
Victim: Jane Doe, 28 years old 

Summary of Events:
The victim, Ms. Jane Doe, reported an ongoing pattern of stalking and harassment by an unknown individual over the past several months. According to Ms. Doe, the stalking behavior began in late December 2022 when she started noticing someone repeatedly showing up wherever she went - her workplace, gym, local coffee shop, and even the grocery store. 

Ms. Doe stated that the suspect, described as a male in his mid-30s, would linger nearby and stare at her intently. On multiple occasions, he attempted to approach her and strike up a conversation, but she ignored him and quickly left the premises each time. The suspect's presence and unwanted attention made Ms. Doe feel extremely uncomfortable and unsafe.

The stalking escalated in February when the suspect began sending Ms. Doe excessive emails, texts, and online messages professing his love and obsession with her, despite never having met her before. He also repeatedly called her cell phone, sometimes over 20 times per day, leaving disturbing voicemails talking about wanting to be part of her life. 

In March, Ms. Doe noticed the suspect loitering outside her apartment building on several nights. She reported seeing his vehicle, a older model blue sedan, parked near the exit of the parking garage when she left for work in the mornings. Fearing for her safety, she began varying her routes and travel times. However, the suspect seemed to anticipate her movements, continuing his pattern of following and watching her from a distance.

Most recently, on April 10th, the suspect managed to obtain Ms. Doe's home address and had an extravagant bouquet of red roses delivered to her apartment with a handwritten note describing his feelings and declaring his hopes to start a relationship with her. This final incident left Ms. Doe feeling threatened and terribly violated, prompting her to file an official police report.

No physical force or weapons were used by the suspect in this stalking case. However, the suspect's persistent harassment, obsessive behaviors, and invasion of the victim's privacy and personal life represent a serious threat. Ms. Doe has expressed grave concerns for her safety and well-being.  

The investigation into identifying and apprehending the suspect is ongoing. Efforts are being made to collect video surveillance footage and phone records that may aid in determining the identity of Ms. Doe's stalker. Once identified, the suspect will be charged with criminal stalking and harassment.
