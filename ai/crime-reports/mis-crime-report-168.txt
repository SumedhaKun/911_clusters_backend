POLICE INCIDENT REPORT

Case Number: 2023-047891

Date of Incident: April 12, 2023
Time of Incident: Between 9:00 AM - 11:30 AM 
Location: Downtown Financial District

Crime Type: Cyber Intrusion, Data Theft, Corporate Espionage

Summary of Incident:
On the morning of April 12th, the corporate headquarters of TechCore Industries reported a major data breach and theft of proprietary information. The IT security team detected unauthorized access to their servers and network around 11:45 AM during a routine security audit. 

Preliminary findings indicate that the perpetrator(s) gained access to TechCore's facilities using social engineering techniques to bypass physical security measures. Specifically, the suspect(s) impersonated an IT consultant scheduled for maintenance work. By exploiting this false identity, they were able to gain entry and move about the premises without raising suspicion.

Once inside, the suspect(s) used common hacking tools like USB keystroke loggers and remote administration tools (RATs) to compromise user login credentials and infiltrate TechCore's cyber infrastructure. No forcible entry or weapons appear to have been used during this incident.

Data logs reveal that terabytes of sensitive research data, client records, and other proprietary files were copied and ex-filtered from TechCore's servers between 9:15 AM and 11:20 AM on the day of the incident.

The motive appears to be corporate espionage and theft of intellectual property, likely to benefit a competitor in the tech sector. TechCore's Chief Security Officer stated this is "one of the most brazen acts of cyber treachery" they have ever witnessed.  

Authorities are reviewing CCTV footage, building access logs, and digital forensics to identify the suspect(s). All available resources are being devoted to investigating this crime and recovering the stolen data.
