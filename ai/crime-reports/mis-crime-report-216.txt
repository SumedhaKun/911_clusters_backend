POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case No: 2023-04718

Crime Type: Home Invasion 

On the night of April 15th, 2023, at approximately 2:15 AM, a home invasion occurred at 517 Oak Tree Lane. The victims, John and Jane Doe, reported being awoken by loud noises coming from the first floor of their residence. 

Modes of Accessing Victims: The perpetrators gained entry through the back door of the home using common tools to access secure locations such as a lock picking kit and a pry bar. Evidence at the scene indicates the lock on the back door was compromised.

Once inside, the victims reported that three masked individuals brandishing weapons confronted them in their upstairs bedroom. Minimal force in the form of physical restraints was used to subdue Mr. and Mrs. Doe and prevent them from raising any alarm.

Weapons Used: The perpetrators were armed with semiautomatic handguns, described as black in color. They threatened the victims with these firearms but did not discharge them during the home invasion.

The criminals demanded valuables and cash, which the victims complied with for their own safety. Jewelry, electronics, and approximately $5,000 in cash were taken from the residence. After obtaining these items, the perpetrators fled the scene on foot.

Evidence collected at the crime scene includes fingerprints, shoe impressions, and security camera footage from a neighboring property that may have captured the perpetrators' vehicle. The investigation is ongoing as law enforcement works to identify the suspects involved in this serious crime.

Victims were shaken but did not sustain any injuries due to the minimal force used by the perpetrators. They have been advised to consult counseling services to cope with the trauma of this event.
