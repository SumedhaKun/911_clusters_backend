INCIDENT REPORT
Case #: 2023-04619

Date/Time of Incident: April 15, 2023 - 02:14 AM 

Location: 715 Oak Tree Lane, Bayville

Type of Crime: Homicide (Violent Crime - Murder)

SUMMARY:

On the morning of April 15th at approximately 2:14 AM, police responded to a 911 call reporting a home invasion and violent attack at 715 Oak Tree Lane. Upon arrival, officers discovered the body of the homeowner, 67-year-old Richard Williams, lying in a pool of blood in the kitchen area. 

The front door showed clear signs of forced entry, with deep gouging marks from what appeared to be a crowbar. A length of rope was also found just inside the entrance, presumably used to restrain the victim during the invasion.

According to the medical examiner's preliminary findings, Mr. Williams suffered extensive blunt force trauma to the head and torso area caused by a crowbar. He also had multiple stab wounds across his upper body from what is believed to be a large kitchen knife taken from within the home.

Evidence at the scene suggests Mr. Williams fought back against his attacker(s) before ultimately succumbing to his injuries. A safe in the upstairs bedroom had been forced open, and the contents, including cash, jewelry and other valuables, were missing.

Neighbors reported hearing loud crashing noises and a man's screams coming from the residence between 2:00-2:30 AM, but no one actually witnessed the incident or the perpetrators.

The investigation is ongoing, and police are canvassing the area for any available security footage that may have captured the suspect(s) arriving at or leaving the scene. Forensic specialists have collected multiple pieces of evidence, including blood samples, fibers, and fingerprints for analysis.

At this time there are no named suspects, but the violent nature of this crime has deeply shaken the community. Police are urging anyone who may have witnessed anything suspicious in the Oak Tree Lane area early Sunday morning to immediately come forward with information.
