POLICE REPORT
Case #: 2023-04619
Crime: Embezzlement  

Summary of Incident:
On April 12th, 2023, the West City Police Department received a report from TechCorp Inc. regarding an internal embezzlement scheme conducted by a former employee, Samuel Jennings (DOB 03/15/1982). Jennings had been employed as a Senior Accountant at TechCorp for the past 8 years. 

An internal audit uncovered that over a period of 3 years, from January 2020 to March 2023, Jennings had been systematically siphoning funds from TechCorp's accounts payable system into his personal offshore bank accounts. The total amount embezzled is estimated to be $3.4 million.

Modus Operandi:
Jennings abused his access privileges and knowledge of TechCorp's financial systems to carry out the embezzlement scheme. Using his computer workstation and specialized accounting software, he was able to override security protocols and approve fraudulent payments to shell companies he had set up.

The payments were then transferred from TechCorp's accounts to the shell companies' accounts, which Jennings controlled. From there, he further transferred the embezzled funds to his personal offshore accounts in the Cayman Islands to cover his tracks.

No physical force or weapons were utilized during the commission of this crime. Jennings relied solely on his insider access, technical skills, and ability to exploit vulnerabilities in TechCorp's financial systems.

Current Status:
Samuel Jennings has been terminated from TechCorp and is currently a wanted fugitive. All financial accounts and assets linked to him have been frozen pending further investigation. The West City Police Department has issued an arrest warrant and is working closely with federal agencies and international law enforcement to locate and apprehend Jennings.

TechCorp's internal security team is conducting a comprehensive review of their financial controls and protocols to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.

This report has been prepared by Detective Marcus Holden, Financial Crimes Unit, West City Police Department. The investigation remains ongoing.
