POLICE REPORT
Case No: 2023-04-187

Crime Type: Theft 

Date of Incident: April 17th, 2023
Time of Incident: Approximately 2:30 AM

Location: Smith & Co. Accounting Firm, 187 Main Street

Details of Incident:
On the morning of April 17th, a custodian at the Smith & Co. Accounting Firm discovered signs of a break-in and theft upon arriving at the office. The front door showed no signs of forced entry, suggesting that the perpetrator may have used lock picking tools to gain access to the premises. 

Further investigation revealed that the office of the firm's senior partner, John Smith, had been ransacked. Mr. Smith's laptop computer and an external hard drive were reported missing from his office desk. The lock on his office door appeared to have been picked, as there were no signs of damage to the door or lock itself.

The perpetrator seems to have specifically targeted Mr. Smith's office and electronics, as no other offices or areas were disturbed. No other items of significant value were reported missing.

No security cameras were active during the timeframe of the incident, so no visual evidence of the perpetrator is available at this time.

Evidence:
- Picked lock on Mr. Smith's office door
- Lack of forced entry to the main office
- Missing laptop and external hard drive from Mr. Smith's office

Potential Perpetrator(s):
At this stage, there are no known suspects. Police are investigating recent terminated employees or contractors who may have had knowledge of the office layout and security measures. The possibility of a targeted corporate theft or cyber crime cannot be ruled out.

The accounting firm is cooperating fully with the investigation.

Anyone with information about this incident is urged to contact the police immediately.

Case Status: Open/Ongoing Investigation
