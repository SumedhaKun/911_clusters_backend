POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case No. 2023-0415-CF

Date/Time of Incident: April 15, 2023 / 10:30 AM 
Location: 215 Industrial Way, Centerville

INCIDENT DETAILS:
On the morning of April 15th, the Centerville Police Department received an anonymous tip about suspected counterfeiting activities occurring at an industrial warehouse unit. Officers were dispatched to investigate.

Upon arrival, officers discovered a sophisticated counterfeiting operation inside the warehouse. Several high-quality printers, ream upon ream of specialized paper, industrial ink cartridges, and other counterfeiting materials were found and seized as evidence.

The counterfeit currency production line appeared to be operational and running at the time of the raid. Stacks of uncut $20 bill sheets were drying on long tables. In an adjacent room, a large volume of counterfeit merchandise, including purses, watches, and electronics, were also discovered.

Two suspects, identified as Ryan Wilkins (34) and Tara Michaels (28), were present at the scene and immediately taken into custody without incident.

According to statements from the suspects during questioning, they were part of a larger counterfeiting ring that produced and distributed high-quality counterfeit bills and goods throughout the region. The fake currency was near-perfect replicas that could easily dupe unwitting businesses and individuals.

Wilkins stated he obtained the specialized printers, ink, and paper from sources overseas and established the warehouse counterfeiting operation. Michaels was responsible for overseeing the production line and packaging the counterfeit bills for distribution through an established network of runners.

No firearms or other weapons were located, and no evidence of other criminal activities was present at the scene.

The Secret Service has been contacted and federal charges are pending against Wilkins, Michaels, and any other co-conspirators identified as this investigation continues. All evidence has been carefully collected and documented.
