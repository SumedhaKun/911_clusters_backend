Date: April 18, 2023

Crime Type: Burglary
Summary: On the night of April 17th, 2023, a residential home in the suburbs was burglarized. The perpetrators gained entry by picking the front door lock using a lock pick set. Once inside, they utilized a crowbar to forcibly open a secured safe, stealing valuables and cash. Evidence of moderate destructive force was observed.

Details:
The victims, John and Jane Doe, returned to their home at 235 Oakwood Lane after being away for the weekend to find clear signs of a break-in. The front door showed damage consistent with lock picking tools being used to bypass the deadbolt lock. 

Upon entering, it was evident that the burglars had thoroughly ransacked the first floor of the home. Furniture was overturned, drawers emptied, and personal belongings strewn about. In the study, the victims' safe had been pried open, with noticeable crowbar markings on the door frame.

According to the victims' statements, items stolen include:
- $7,500 in cash
- A Rolex watch valued at $12,000  
- Mrs. Doe's diamond necklace ($25,000)
- Various other jewelry pieces

The safe showed clear signs of being forced open using a crowbar or similar prying tool. Impressions on the floor indicated at least two perpetrators were present based on the boot prints found.

No security cameras were installed on the premises, and no neighbors reported any suspicious activity that evening. Forensic teams were dispatched to dust for fingerprints and collect any additional evidence.

The investigation is still ongoing. Anyone with information about this crime is urged to contact the Police Department immediately.
