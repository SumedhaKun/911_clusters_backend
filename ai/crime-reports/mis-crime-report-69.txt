POLICE INCIDENT REPORT

Case #: 2022-187459
Incident Type: Burglary 
Date/Time: April 21, 2022 / 2:17 AM
Location: 415 Oak Tree Lane, Oakwood

SUMMARY OF INCIDENT:

On April 21, 2022 at approximately 2:17 AM, officers responded to a residential burglary in progress at 415 Oak Tree Lane in the suburban neighborhood of Oakwood. The homeowners, John and Jane Smith, were awoken by loud noises coming from the first floor of their home. Upon investigating, Mr. Smith witnessed two masked individuals inside their living room attempting to remove a large flat screen television from the wall mount. 

Mr. Smith immediately called 911 while Mrs. Smith locked herself in an upstairs bedroom closet. Responding officers arrived on scene within 5 minutes to find signs of forced entry through a rear kitchen window. The perpetrators appeared to have utilized a crowbar and rubber mallet to pry open the locked window from the outside. Once inside, the burglars proceeded to ransack the main floor, overturning furniture and emptying drawers.

Evidence recovered at the scene included a large flathead screwdriver, likely used to attempt removing the mounted TV, as well as a backpack filled with valuables including jewelry, cash, and electronics belonging to the victims. Muddy footprints and pry marks indicate the perpetrators accessed the property from the wooded area behind the residence.

The suspects fled on foot prior to police arrival after being startled by Mr. Smith. A perimeter was quickly established by additional responding units and a K9 team was called in to assist in tracking the suspects, however the trail went cold after leading approximately half a mile into the woods behind the home.
