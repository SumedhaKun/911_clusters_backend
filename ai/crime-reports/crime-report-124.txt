POLICE REPORT
Case No: 2023-07182
Date: April 12, 2023

INCIDENT DETAILS:
On April 10th, 2023, the Cyber Crimes Division received a complaint from VictimCorp, a leading financial technology firm. The company reported a major data breach that compromised sensitive customer information and intellectual property. 

According to the preliminary investigation, an unknown individual or group gained unauthorized access to VictimCorp's secure servers through the internet. The perpetrators employed sophisticated malware and phishing techniques to bypass the company's cyber defenses.

The malware, identified as "EvilCryptor3000," is a new and dangerous strain of ransomware that encrypts files and holds them for ransom. Forensic analysis revealed that the phishing emails impersonated VictimCorp's IT department, tricking employees into revealing their login credentials. Armed with these credentials, the perpetrators could move laterally through the network until reaching the critical data repositories.

No physical force or conventional weapons were used in this crime. However, the "digital force" exerted by the malware has rendered several terabytes of data inaccessible to VictimCorp. The company has been effectively held hostage, with the perpetrators demanding a ransom payment of 5 million dollars in untraceable cryptocurrency.

EVIDENCE COLLECTED:
- Samples of the "EvilCryptor3000" malware
- Phishing email records
- Log files from VictimCorp's servers and firewalls
- CCTV footage of the IT department (currently being analyzed for suspicious activities)

VICTIM IMPACT:
The data breach has caused significant financial and reputational damage to VictimCorp. The compromised information includes:
- Personal and financial details of over 500,000 customers
- Proprietary source code for VictimCorp's flagship product
- Confidential business contracts and trade secrets

VictimCorp has been forced to shut down its core operations until the situation is resolved. The company estimates losses in excess of $100 million due to downtime, incident response costs, and potential regulatory fines.

INVESTIGATION STATUS: Ongoing
The Cyber Crimes Division, in collaboration with federal agencies, is actively investigating this case. All available cyber forensic resources have been deployed to identify the perpetrators and recover the stolen data. VictimCorp has been advised not to pay the ransom, as it may encourage further attacks.

The public is urged to exercise caution and report any suspicious cyber activities to the authorities immediately.
