Nature of Incident: Motor Vehicle Theft 

Date/Time Reported: April 17, 2023 / 8:15 AM

Location: Public parking garage at 125 Main Street

Reporting Officer: Officer J. Williams, Badge #638

Details of Incident:
On the morning of April 17th, the victim, John Smith (35), reported that his 2019 Toyota Camry was stolen from the parking garage where he had left it the previous evening. Mr. Smith parked on level 3 of the garage at approximately 7:30 PM on April 16th after finishing work downtown. 

When he returned to the garage the next morning at 8 AM, his vehicle was no longer parked in the designated spot. After searching the nearby area, Mr. Smith reported the vehicle stolen to authorities.

The parking garage's security footage revealed that at around 11:45 PM on April 16th, two unidentified individuals entered the garage on foot. They were both wearing dark clothing, baseball caps, and had their faces partially obscured.

The suspects appeared to be using a powerful electronic device to rapidly cycle through door entry codes until they bypassed the garage's security system. Once inside, they located Mr. Smith's Toyota Camry on level 3. 

One of the suspects is seen using a small tool to quickly tamper with the driver's side door lock. Within moments, they gained entry into the vehicle. The other suspect kept lookout during this process.

The footage shows the two suspects leaving the scene at 12:03 AM, driving off in the stolen Camry. No weapons or physical force appeared to be used during the commission of this crime.

The vehicle's information has been entered into state and federal databases in an attempt to locate and recover it. The investigation is ongoing as law enforcement works to identify the suspects involved in this auto theft incident.
