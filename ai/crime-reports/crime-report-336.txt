On the evening of April 23rd, a daring robbery took place at the First Oakwood Bank in downtown Oakwood City. According to witness statements and surveillance footage, three masked individuals gained access to the bank by posing as maintenance workers, allowing them to bypass the security system.

Once inside, the suspects proceeded to the vault area, where they used high-powered cutting tools to breach the reinforced door. Witnesses reported hearing loud noises and seeing sparks emanating from the vault area during the incident.

Upon gaining entry to the vault, the suspects threatened the bank employees at gunpoint, forcing them to comply with their demands. The suspects were armed with semi-automatic handguns and carried duffel bags, which they proceeded to fill with an undisclosed amount of cash and other valuable items, including safety deposit boxes.

Eyewitness accounts describe the suspects as three males, approximately 5'10" to 6'2" in height, wearing dark clothing and ski masks to conceal their identities. They displayed a high level of coordination and efficiency, suggesting prior planning and preparation.

The suspects fled the scene in a black van, which was later found abandoned in a nearby alley. Forensic teams are currently processing the vehicle for any potential evidence.
