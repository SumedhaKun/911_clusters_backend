POLICE REPORT

Incident No: 2023-0415-087 
Date: April 15, 2023
Crime: Fraud

DETAILS OF THE INCIDENT:

On April 15th, 2023 at approximately 10:30 AM, officers responded to a call from Mrs. Jane Smith, an elderly resident of 215 Oak Street, reporting that she had been the victim of a fraud scheme. Upon arrival, officers interviewed Mrs. Smith who stated the following:

Earlier that morning around 9:15 AM, a man came to her front door claiming to be a utility worker who needed to check her home's electrical wiring. The suspect wore a convincing uniform with a fake ID badge. Mrs. Smith allowed him inside.

Once inside, the suspect claimed her electrical panel needed urgent repairs that would cost several thousand dollars. The suspect frantically urged her to withdraw cash from her bank right away before leaving for urgent repairs he claimed were needed. 

The suspect then accompanied Mrs. Smith to her bank branch and waited outside while she withdrew $8,500 from her savings account. Upon returning outside, the suspect took the cash from her and claimed he needed to get repair supplies from his truck. The suspect then fled the area on foot with the victim's cash.

No repairs were ever performed and the suspect, who employed deception and impersonation to gain access to the victim's home, is still at large. Surveillance footage from the bank captured images of the suspect, described as:

- White male
- Approximately 40 years old 
- 5'10" tall, medium build
- Short brown hair, clean shaven
- Wore a blue utility uniform with "City Power & Electric" logos

The suspect gained entry by impersonating a utility worker, a common tactic used to access secure locations and gain victims' trust in fraud crimes. No weapons or force were used in this particular incident, as the suspect relied on deception and impersonation to defraud the victim of her life savings.

This case has been assigned to Detective Mark Johnson. Anyone with information about this incident or the identity of the suspect is urged to call the tips hotline immediately.
