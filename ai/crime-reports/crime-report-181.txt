POLICE REPORT
Case #: 2023-04785

Crime: Vandalism 

Date/Time: April 12, 2023 / 2:15 AM

Location: 125 Oak Street, Oakville

Summary of Incident:
On the morning of April 12th, officers responded to a call regarding extensive property damage at the Oak Valley Shopping Plaza. Upon arrival, they discovered that the entire side wall of the Starbucks had been defaced with large graffiti tags and crude imagery spray painted in red, black and white paint. 

Further investigation revealed that several of the plaza's storefront windows had been smashed, likely by blunt objects such as hammers or sledgehammers based on the force used and the shattered glass patterns. Debris was strewn about the parking lot, and several planters had been overturned and destroyed.

Witnesses reported seeing a group of 4-5 individuals, dressed in dark clothing with their faces obscured, fleeing the scene on foot around 2:00 AM. No weapons were seen, but they appeared to be carrying cans of spray paint and tools.

The vandalism caused thousands of dollars in damage to the businesses. The graffiti contained no clear motive, but consisted of illegible tags, explicit words, and disturbing imagery. Samples of the spray paint have been collected for analysis.

The investigation is ongoing as officers review surveillance footage and follow up on leads. Anyone with further information about this incident is urged to contact the Oakville Police Department.
