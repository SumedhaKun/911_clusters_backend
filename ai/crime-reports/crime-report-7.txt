INCIDENT SUMMARY:

On April 12th at approximately 2:37 AM, officers responded to a panic alarm at the Oakwood Community Bank on Main Street. Upon arrival, they found the night security guard, John Roberts (35), bound and gagged in the bank lobby. 

Mr. Roberts stated that around 2:15 AM, he was making his usual rounds when he heard a noise coming from the vault area. As he approached, a masked suspect emerged from the vault brandishing a handgun. The suspect threatened to shoot Mr. Roberts if he did not comply with demands. 

The suspect had apparently picked the lock to the vault room using a professional lock pick set. Once inside the vault, he was able to access several safe deposit boxes and make away with an undetermined amount of cash, jewelry and other valuables.

After subduing Mr. Roberts, the suspect fled the bank on foot heading eastbound on Main Street. Officers established a perimeter but were unable to locate the suspect. The FBI has been notified and the investigation is ongoing.
