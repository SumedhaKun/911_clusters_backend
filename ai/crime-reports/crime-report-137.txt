Police Report #2022-07184

Nature of Crime: Arson 

On the night of June 12th, 2022, multiple units from the Denver Fire Department responded to a commercial fire at Gardner's Warehouse & Distribution Center located at 5670 Newport Street. Upon arrival at approximately 2:35 AM, firefighters encountered heavy smoke and flames billowing from the northeast corner of the large warehouse facility.

After bringing the intense fires under control, investigators from the Denver Police Department's Arson Unit were called to the scene to determine the origin and cause. Evidence at the scene indicated a criminal act of arson.

Security footage from the warehouse showed an unidentified suspect dressed in dark clothing cutting through the perimeter chain link fence on the northeast side using bolt cutters at approximately 2:15 AM. The suspect then forced entry into the warehouse through a side door, also using bolt cutters to breach the lock. 

Once inside, the arsonist appeared to use an accelerant, believed to be gasoline based on the burn patterns and gas can found nearby, to start multiple fires throughout the warehouse aisles containing stored merchandise and inventory. Matches or a lighter are thought to have been used as the ignition source. The resulting fast-moving fires caused significant damage and destruction of property.

Total estimated losses are still being calculated, but are expected to be well into the millions due to the warehouse containing electronics, furniture, clothing and other high-value goods. Thankfully, the facility was unoccupied at the time so there were no injuries.

Police are reviewing additional security footage from nearby businesses and residences for any leads on potential suspects or vehicles involved. A reward is being offered for any information leading to the identification and arrest of the arsonist(s) responsible for this brazen act.

The Arson Unit is leading the active criminal investigation. Anyone with information is urged to contact Denver Police or anonymously call Crime Stoppers.
