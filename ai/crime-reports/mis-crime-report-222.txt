DETAILS OF THE INCIDENT:

On the night of April 15th, a daring robbery took place at the First National Bank in downtown Centerville. According to witness statements and surveillance footage, three masked individuals gained physical access to the bank premises through a rear entrance. 

The suspects, who remain unidentified, appeared to have intimate knowledge of the bank's security protocols. They employed common tools used to access secure locations, such as lock-picking devices and a high-powered drill, to breach the vault room door. 

Once inside, the suspects used physical force and intimidation tactics to subdue the two security guards on duty. One guard sustained minor injuries after being struck with the butt of a handgun wielded by one of the suspects.

The robbers proceeded to empty the vault of an undisclosed amount of cash and valuables. Witnesses reported hearing loud bangs, presumed to be from the discharge of a firearm, although no gunshot injuries were reported.

The suspects fled the scene in a dark-colored van, leaving behind a trail of evidence, including spent cartridge casings, torn clothing, and a discarded ski mask.
