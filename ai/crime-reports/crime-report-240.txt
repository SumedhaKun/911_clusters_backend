Incident Type: Motor Vehicle Theft
Location: 125 Oak Street, Centerville

SUMMARY OF INCIDENT:

On April 15th at approximately 2:37 AM, officers responded to a report of a motor vehicle theft in progress at 125 Oak Street. Upon arrival, officers found a 2018 Honda Civic with a broken driver's side window. The vehicle was still running with the keys in the ignition.

Witnesses reported seeing two suspects wearing dark clothing and ski masks smash the driver's side window with an object believed to be a screwdriver. One suspect then entered the vehicle through the broken window while the other kept watch. The suspect inside the vehicle appeared to be manipulating wires under the steering column, likely attempting to hot-wire the vehicle.

After a brief period, the engine started and the two suspects fled the area in the stolen vehicle, last seen heading westbound on Oak Street. A perimeter was quickly established but the suspects were not located.

The following items were collected from the scene as evidence:

- Shattered glass from the broken window
- Screwdriver with a red plastic handle (possible tool used)
- Footage from a nearby home security camera showing the two suspects
