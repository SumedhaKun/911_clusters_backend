POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
Case #2023-04162

Crime: Embezzlement 

Date/Time: April 5th, 2023 / Between 9am-5pm

Location: Maxwell Financial Corp, 125 Corporate Blvd

Victim: Maxwell Financial Corp

Suspect: John Roberts, 46 years old, Vice President of Accounting

Details of Incident:
On the morning of April 6th, the CEO of Maxwell Financial Corp, Emily Richards, contacted authorities after irregularities were found in the company's financial records during a routine audit. Over the course of the previous 8 months, a total of $347,000 had been slowly siphoned out of various accounts into an unauthorized slush fund.

An internal investigation traced the illegal money trail back to the VP of Accounting, John Roberts. Roberts had been with the company for 12 years and had complete oversight of the accounting systems and processes. He abused his position of authority to gain unauthorized access to company funds and make illegitimate transfers to cover up his theft.

Using his knowledge of the protocols, Roberts was able to circumvent security checks by creating fake vendor accounts and invoices assigned to those phantom companies. He would then approve the fake invoices himself and initiate transfers from Maxwell Financial's operating accounts to temporarily cover the payments. Shortly after, he would siphon the money out to an offshore account he controlled.

Roberts utilized his company-issued credit card and online banking credentials to execute the illegal transactions. No physical weapons or force was used in the course of the crime.

When confronted by Maxwell Financial's corporate security team, Roberts initially denied any wrongdoing. However, once authorities obtained financial records and transaction logs, the evidence became overwhelming. Roberts ultimately confessed to embezzling funds to fuel his gambling addiction after racking up over $250,000 in debts to loansharks.

Roberts was arrested on charges of embezzlement, fraud, and money laundering. He is currently awaiting trial while out on $500,000 bail. Maxwell Financial is pursuing civil litigation to attempt to recover the stolen funds. The investigation is ongoing to determine if any other individuals were complicit in the crime.
