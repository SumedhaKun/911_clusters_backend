POLICE REPORT

Case Number: 2023-0415-CF

Date: April 15, 2023

Crime: Counterfeiting Currency

Reporting Officer: Detective Jamie Knowles, Financial Crimes Unit 

On April 14th, 2023, an anonymous tip was received by the Financial Crimes Unit regarding a suspected counterfeiting operation taking place at 415 Maple Street. Officers conducted surveillance on the residence for 36 hours.

At approximately 8:00 AM on April 15th, a search warrant was executed at the residence. Upon entering, officers discovered an extensive counterfeiting setup in the basement. Several high-end printers, specialized inks and paper, and other counterfeiting materials were seized. 

In addition, officers found over $100,000 in counterfeit $20 bills in various stages of production. The counterfeit currency was extremely well-produced and would likely be difficult for the average person to detect as fake. 

Three suspects were apprehended at the scene - Brian Walker (age 32), Maria Gonzalez (age 28), and Frank Dillinger (age 51). All three suspects were advised of their rights and agreed to be interviewed.

Walker admitted to acquiring the printers and materials needed for the operation. Gonzalez handled actually printing the counterfeit bills using specialized inks and paper. Dillinger was in charge of distributing the fake cash through his connections.

No weapons or evidence of other crimes beyond counterfeiting were uncovered during the search. The counterfeit bills, printers, and materials were seized as evidence. The three suspects were arrested and charged with counterfeiting, possession of counterfeit currency, and criminal conspiracy.

This appears to have been a large-scale counterfeiting ring producing extremely high-quality fake cash. The U.S. Secret Service has been contacted and will be leading the ongoing investigation from here.
