Police Report #2023-0415

Incident Type: Arson 
Date/Time: April 15, 2023 / 2:37 AM
Location: Wilson Industrial Park, Warehouse 24B

On the morning of April 15th, the emergency dispatch center received multiple 911 calls reporting a large fire at a warehouse in the Wilson Industrial Park. Fire crews from three municipalities responded to the scene and fought for several hours to extinguish the massive blaze. 

Upon arriving, arson investigators from the City Police Department noted clear signs of forced entry into Warehouse 24B. A section of the perimeter chain-link fencing had been cut open, likely using bolt cutters found discarded nearby. Scuff marks on the concrete floor indicated a heavy object being dragged inside the warehouse.

Once the fire was contained, investigators were able to process the scene. They discovered multiple points of origin for the fire, indicating an intentionally set arson. Traces of gasoline were detected, and partially burnt book matches littered the floor in several locations. 

Security footage from neighboring businesses showed a panel van backing up to the rear entrance of 24B around 2:15 AM. Two individuals wearing hoodies and masks are seen exiting the van. One person appears to be carrying a gas can. They force their way inside and remain for approximately 15 minutes before fleeing the area on foot just before the first explosions.

At this time, the investigation is ongoing and no suspects have been publicly identified. The owner of the warehouse, Apex Logistics Inc., is cooperating fully and assessing their inventory losses. A review of the company's finances and business dealings is underway to determine any potential motives.

The Wilson Industrial Park arson caused severe damage estimated at over $3 million. Thankfully, the fire crews responded quickly and no injuries have been reported. Police are asking anyone who may have witnessed suspicious activity in the area between 2-3 AM to contact the Arson Hotline immediately.
