INCIDENT REPORT
Case #: 2023-14875
Date: April 12, 2023
Crime: Burglary

On the night of April 11th, 2023, a residential burglary occurred at 215 Maple Lane. The homeowners, John and Jane Smith, returned home around 10:30 PM to find their front window shattered and several rooms in disarray. 

Evidence at the scene indicates the perpetrator(s) used a crowbar to forcefully pry open the front window for entry into the home. Once inside, the burglar(s) ransacked multiple rooms, rifling through drawers and overturning furniture. Muddy footprints were found throughout the house, suggesting the intruder(s) tracked debris from outside.

Surveillance footage from a neighboring home captured a suspicious figure lurking near the Smith residence around 8:45 PM. The grainy video shows a male subject wearing a dark hoodie and carrying what appears to be a crowbar or similar prying tool. At one point, the individual is seen forcefully breaking the front window before entering the premises.

Forensic teams processed the scene and collected various pieces of evidence, including the suspected crowbar, shattered glass samples, and fingerprints from various surfaces within the home. While no weapons were involved, the burglar(s) likely used physical force to gain compliance from any potential witnesses or residents present during the crime.  

Stolen items reported by the homeowners include a flat-screen TV, an expensive jewelry collection, and approximately $500 in cash. Total losses are currently estimated at $12,000.

The investigation is still ongoing as law enforcement officials canvass the neighborhood for any additional witnesses or surveillance footage that could aid in identifying the suspect(s) involved in this brazen burglary. Anyone with information is urged to contact the police department immediately.
