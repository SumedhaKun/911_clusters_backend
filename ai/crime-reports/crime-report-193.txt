INCIDENT REPORT
Case #2023-04187
Reporting Officer: Det. J. Alvarez 
Date/Time Reported: 04/22/2023 - 0325 hours

Incident Type: Homicide

On the night of 04/21/2023, patrol officers responded to a call of a possible break-in at the Smith Jewelry Store located at 425 Main St. Upon arrival, officers discovered the rear entrance to the store had been forcibly breached. 

Once inside, officers located the body of the store owner, Michael Smith (54 years old), lying face down behind the counter area. The victim appeared to have suffered severe blunt force trauma to the head. A bloodied pry bar was located near the victim.

Further investigation revealed that access to the secure jewelry cases appeared to have been gained through the use of a thick nylon rope found on the premises. The rope showed signs of being used to rappel from the roof access point down to the main showroom floor. 

Numerous pieces of jewelry were found to be missing from the smashed cases, leading investigators to theorize that the primary motive was robbery. However, the vicious killing and use of physical force against Mr. Smith goes beyond typical smash-and-grab tactics.

At this time, no suspects have been identified but forensic teams are processing the scene for DNA, fingerprints and additional physical evidence. The investigation is ongoing.

Witnesses are asked to contact the police hotline at 555-0192 with any information regarding suspicious persons or activity in the vicinity of 425 Main St between the hours of 10 PM on 04/21/2023 and 3:15 AM on 04/22/2023.
